over the place with <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2006/03/16/WS-Gartner">Tim Bray</a> 
and <a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/dbox/archive/2006/03/18/20235.aspx">Don Box</a>

I think <a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=83ec4876-7578-418c-8335-a3b0a147037b" title="Building a New Web Service at Google">Dare Obasanjo&#8217;s notes</a> from <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:9oV3TSIAzsEJ:buzz.blogger.com/media/minar-etech-2005.ppt+high-rest&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=3">a talk</a> given by Google&#8217;s
<a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/et2005/view/e_spkr/555">Nelson Minar</a>
almost a year ago may have put some valuable terminology behind ideas that
have been floating around for some time and may have even brought us to a place where we can have an actual conversation about this stuff:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To begin he defined what he called &#8216;low REST&#8217; (i.e. Plain Old XML over
  HTTP or POX) and &#8216;high REST&#8217;. Low REST implies using HTTP GETs for all
  API accesses but remembering that GET requests should not have side
  effects. High REST involves using the four main HTTP verbs (GET, POST,
  PUT, and DELETE) to manipulate resource representations, using XML
  documents as message payloads, putting metadata in HTTP headers and
  using URLs meaningfully.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The definitions of low REST / high REST could be tweaked a bit (maybe they were when I wasn&#8217;t looking?)
but I do like the idea of putting terms we can all agree on to the
subset that&#8217;s the reality behind most of machine/web interfaces that
seem to be working today. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_Old_XML">POX</a> 
isn&#8217;t that term because it unnessarily constrains the media type; &#8220;low REST&#8221; 
should include the mostly non-XML web (i.e. the <code>text/html</code>, <code>image/*</code>,
<code>text/css</code>, <code>text/javascript</code>, etc. web) where it conforms to the
constraints of GET and POST.</p>

<p>The reason I like this approach is because it could remove the
artificial and often harmful separation made between the web <em>people</em>
interact with and the web <em>machines</em> interact with. Exposing resources for
machine consumption isn&#8217;t any different than exposing resources for
human consumption until you get down to the media type (and not
then if you subscribe to <a href="http://microformats.org/">Microformats</a>). 
That is, some form of hyper-media (links / URIs) and a simple, universal 
interface (HTTP) are the really big wins you get with REST because those 
things are what creates the possibility of having a hugely distributed and 
uncoordinated system of interaction. The choice of document format is 
something else entirely and the decisions there ought to be based on a 
whole other set of concerns.</p>

<p>If I cared at all about the term anymore, I would go so far as to say
that anything conforming to the constraints of at least one HTTP method
and that also exposes references to other resources using URIs should be
considered &#8220;a web service&#8221;. But &#8220;web service&#8221; has been defined to death and
it doesn&#8217;t seem to be helping.</p>

<p>The first time I heard someone attempt to describe the GET/POST
subset as something we should pay attention to was 
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/mikechampion/">Michael Champion</a> on xml-dev. This was
usually thrown out when someone championing REST used the &#8220;REST is the
web and the web is working&#8221; argument (I use that argument to this day,
btw). Michael would often be the one to point out that it wasn&#8217;t <em>exactly</em> 
true and that a subset of what REST describes seemed to be working well on 
the web (GET/POST, URIs, caching), while another subset was 
clearly&mdash;sometimes knowingly&mdash;being violated (GET w/ side-effects, uncool URIs), 
and yet another subset was used only rarely (PUT/DELETE/OPTIONS, content
negotiation).</p>

<p>Not being able to distinguish which of these subsets of applied REST one
is refering to is hurting our ability to have meaningful conversations
about this stuff. For example, consider the following conversation; I&#8217;ve
seen it hundreds of times now:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><cite>Restafarian</cite>: 80% of developers use the XXX REST API because 
  they find it easier to deal with.<br />
  <cite>Tool Vendor</cite>: That&#8217;s not really REST. It only uses GET and POST and breaks rule #5034<br />
  <cite>Restafarian</cite>: Oh yea, well SOAP/WS-* sucks.<br />
  <cite>Tool Vendor</cite>: Go write some PHP you dirty hippie!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;d like that to stop happening.</p>

<p>But I don&#8217;t think adopting wrong or ambiguous terminology is going to
help either. I&#8217;d like to register my nits with the few sentences that
Dare provided and see if anyone else is thinking along similar lines.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To begin he defined what he called &#8216;low REST&#8217; (i.e. Plain Old XML over
  HTTP or POX) and &#8216;high REST&#8217;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Like I said before, POX is kind of, ummm, bad, I think. It focuses too much 
on the format. XML is not why the web is working. URLs and HTTP is
why the web is working. HTTP and URLs work so well they&#8217;re even capable
of being useful <em>in spite of</em> complexities in media-types based on XML.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Low REST implies using HTTP GETs for all API accesses but remembering
  that GET requests should not have side effects.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fully constrained GETs are really important but POST should fall under
low-REST too. By the definition above, low-REST can never modify
anything. Throw POST in there, it&#8217;s a big part of the present day
human/web and is likely to play a bigger role in the machine/web.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>High REST involves using the four main HTTP verbs (GET, POST,
  PUT, and DELETE) to manipulate resource representations, using XML
  documents as message payloads, putting metadata in HTTP headers and
  using URLs meaningfully.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think we ought to downgrade XML to a &#8220;<del>best</del><ins>common</ins>
practice&#8221; or something.  Microformats and JSON are two notable examples
of non-XML representations that seem to be working quite well and are
absolutely capable of being used high-RESTfully.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure I&#8217;ll always be a high-RESTafarian but I could definitely
see myself <a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/dbox/archive/2006/03/18/20246.aspx">coming out as a lo-RESTafarian</a>
as well if some of this were grinded out a bit more.</p>

			<p>Why the XML hate?</p>
<p>Microformats are an excellent approach to enable serendipitous scraping of information intended primarily for human consumption so that it can subsequently be reused. This is what the contemporary open web consists of, so putting more of it in microformats would be great. I would never store data in HTML-based microformats, though, neither as the producer (in whose position I’d keep the data in more structured storage and only render it to microformat via templates prior to serving) nor as the consumer (in whose position I’d scrape the data off the page and then dump it into a more structured and more easily queried store). I’d always prefer to work with an API that provides the same data in machine-readable format. The strength of microformats is broadcasting: they make a great generic back-channel for apps not versed in specific APIs and wire formats.</p>
<p>JSON’s strength is expressing highly structured data where the structure has low variability: basically, for pushing <em>objects</em> across the wire. JSON makes a great choice with minimal fricition for off-the-cuff APIs.</p>
<p>But for standardized APIs that will have many different implementations on both ends of the wire, XML really is the wire format of choice. Namespaces provide a builtin hook for implementation-specific extensions. It goes without saying that XML/SGML-type markup is great for weakly structured data such as documents – XPath also makes it suitable at the other extreme of the spectrum, for highly variable nestable structures. (I love this little language more than anything. If I never have to write another piece of ad-hoc tree-walking code to locate bits and pieces in a tree, it won’t be soon enough.) In addition, doing XML means that meeting the minimum requirements for i18n is a <em>prerequisite</em>. (What’s the status of JSON with regard to charsets? I admit ignorance here.)</p>
<p>If you want to see a great example of the stuff I’m talking about (high-REST POX that plays to XML’s strengths), read the Atom Publishing Protocol spec, which is winding down to its finishing touches. That stuff’s gonna catch on, tell you what.</p>

			<p>Aristotle: XML definitely hits a sweet spot with all the things you mentioned (that&#8217;s exactly where my head was w/ Kid) but doesn&#8217;t it seem like we&#8217;ve been putting too much emphasis on content type? I wonder if things might have worked out better if the black-hole created by XML didn&#8217;t dwarf all the other considerations. </p>
<p>I think <em>RSS</em> is actually a perfect example of what I&#8217;m talking about. It sucks, is almost never directly parsable XML, has compatibility issues too numerous for a normal person to fully understand, and yet it&#8217;s still doing really well somehow. It exhibits very few, if any, of the benefits we&#8217;ve come to associate with XML. I try to rationalize the situation by telling myself that HTTP and URIs have to be the key ingredients and that, in practice, there&#8217;s a high level of tolerance for bad, broken, incomplete, etc. media types. I&#8217;m completely behind Atom in every way but I think RSS says a lot about the nature of the web.</p>
<p>And Microformats is probably a bad example of a non-XML representation since they are based on XHTML (but without the media type). The point I was trying to make, though, was that you should be able to attack the question of document format based on your needs starting with the simplest thing that can possibly work. If you can extend your existing HTML markup a bit and get 80% of the integration capabilities you require, that&#8217;s probably going to be a good decision. If, later, you find yourself requiring that additional 10%-15%, you roll something in alongside your Microformats approach using a more specialized XML format (e.g. actually use content negotiation or have a whole other URI hierarchy, whatever). If you&#8217;re into that top 5% range, you start considering how you might make the various WS-* specs work with the web.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the approach I like to work with and I just wonder if the constant focus on XML for so long hasn&#8217;t twisted our minds up in a way that makes it hard to see what&#8217;s really important.</p>

			<p>Ryan,</p>
<p>You are one of the rare techno geeks I know who keeps insisting on placing common sense at the very top of our concerns. I like that. God knows it&#8217;s incredibly hard to get geeks in general to become sensitive to and to start differentiating between what&#8217;s possible and what&#8217;s probable.</p>
<p>Even if we&#8217;re building a system that&#8217;s 98% idempotent in its functionality, the geeks will still hijack the proceedings and force the 98% of operations to adopt the heavy load that would satisfy the remaining 2%. That&#8217;s definitely the biggest source of all my frustrations when working with software development teams.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve nicely illstrated that with your analysis of the lopsided emphasis on XML.</p>

			<p>I think the best advise here is &#8220;starting with the simplest thing that can possibly work&#8221;.</p>
<p>In some cases, I get most mileage out of using microformats, and everything else is just a layer of indirection. But microformats have their limits, and in other cases XML works better. RSS are great for some stuff, they&#8217;re an overkill if you&#8217;re doing an authentication API. And let&#8217;s not forget JSON.</p>
<p>You can write a whole article on what to use when, I think that would be useful. But the key point is discretion: use all of these, but for each use case pick the ones that are most effective.</p>
<p>The only barrier to using XML and RSS and microformats and JSON is learning. The barrier to using XML when you should be using microformats, or RSS when you should be using JSON is complex code that&#8217;s difficult to write and maintain.</p>
<p>As for REST, I follow the same approach. Which means most of my Web stuff break REST by relying on cookies, and most of my APIs break REST by asking you to construct URLs. And so far I&#8217;ve only had use for GET/POST.</p>
<p>I call it lightweight services. It&#8217;s about keeping services simple to implement, use and maintain. And it so happens that a lot of REST gets used because REST fits the bill.</p>

<p>I am strongly convinced that the reason that RSS seems to be holding up (which I will assume means RSS 2.0, since earlier versions are RDF, even if noone parses them that way) is that it hasn’t been pushed. It’s not used for anything much other than shovelling weblog content into readers, which content consists mostly of tag soup anyway. So the fact that RSS seems to work is really no more to the point than the fact that HTML tag soup seems to work.</p>
<p>I do agree with your basic thesis that REST succeeds because of the REST principles and does not depend much on the wire format. The position you put forth in the article just seemed to veer into “we’d be better off without XML,” rather than staying on the “XML isn’t what matters” course, so that’s what I addressed in my comment.</p>
<p><cite><a href="http://lesscode.org/2006/03/19/high-low-rest/#comment-1299">Alex</a></cite>,</p>
<p>don’t be silly. You won’t find many who will argue that excessive model complexity is worth its diminishing coverage returns. People aren’t stupid. The problem is that one man’s 98% are another’s 55%. People disagree about how much of the problem space constitutes the 80% worth addressing. Your portrayal of the problem conveniently skips over the hard part; unfortunately, reality is rarely that tractable.</p>

<p>All I was talking about is an idempotent portion of a system (an exactly measurable feature). How you inferred that one man&#8217;s 98% of idempotency is another&#8217;s 55% is beyond the grasping capabilities of my feeble mind.</p>

			<p>[&#8230;] Pick one, and only one of these arguments, please. As far as I can see, apart from a few rare exceptions (like WebDAV), Don&#8217;s lo-REST &#8212; HTTP GET and POST only &#8212; is what&#8217;s been proven on the web. The pure Book of Fielding, hi-REST GET/POST/PUT/DELETE version is every bit as speculative and unproven as Web Services/SOAP/SOA themselves (that&#8217;s not to say that it&#8217;s wrong; simply that it&#8217;s unproven). Some REST supportors, like Ryan Tomayko, are already starting to acknowledge this contradiction. [&#8230;]</p>

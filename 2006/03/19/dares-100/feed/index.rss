					<description>&lt;p&gt;I'd love to have something this as an option over the JS SAX interface:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://effbot.org/zone/element-iterparse.htm&quot;&gt;The ElementTree iterparse Function&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will be standard python soon so the Iron Python folks should get right on it ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

					<description>&lt;p&gt;Right. I want other ways to use XML that aren't DOM, and I don't see what this has to with JSON.&lt;/p&gt;

					<description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t understand the argument. Most people use JSON, so we should live with DOM forever?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry - was being too terse. In verbose form that should have read;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hardly anyone is using XML in AJAX[. Instead they're using ] JSON and other approaches...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we're in agreement – approaches like JSON and similar (e.g. Google suggest simply returns some Javascript which, when evaled, executes a local callback function) are preferable as you get immediate access to your data structures, vs. fighting with DOM. There's probably also a performance gain.&lt;/p&gt;

					<description>&lt;p&gt;That $40 on XML and browser seems like money wasted. Hardly anyone is using XML in AJAX – JSON and other approaches (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2005/12/the_ajax_respon.html&quot;&gt;The AJAX response: XML, HTML, or JSON?&lt;/a&gt;). The point there is XML's platform independence has no value to a browser, given cross domain restrictions – AJAX is about specific relationships between a Javascript client and a single domain name (i.e. a single server-side platform).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Better take that $40 for fixing browser HTTP auth and supporting logoffs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact looking at Dare's spending plan, it's not pretty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next $30 would be better spent on teaching developers the details of HTTP. .NET already has HTTP support. Let's not hide it all behind a bunch of &quot;keep developers dumb&quot; APIs&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then that $20 – how about spending that on introducing some &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.array.php&quot;&gt;flexible data types&lt;/a&gt; instead - the sort that allow you easily represent &quot;ad-hoc&quot; XML structures, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally that $10 – well perhaps this could go to adding E4X to IE?&lt;/p&gt;

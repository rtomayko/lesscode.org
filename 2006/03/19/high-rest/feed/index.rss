					<description>&lt;p&gt;[...] High REST: I also call this &amp;#8220;Unicorn REST&amp;#8221; because, in the words of Don Ferguson, this type is a little bit more common than unicorns. This is REST as laid out by Roy Fielding. It makes use of all the HTTP verbs and has a completely stateless server. Status codes are these developers best friends. [...]&lt;/p&gt;

					<description>&lt;p&gt;Yeah, but if you really want to look at &quot;high&quot; REST&quot;, you'll first have to remove the bongwater from under your eyelids.
This will help you perpetuate a much more clear image of REST and once you have done that, &quot;high&quot; has already be determined. Beyond this, I see no reason to split ATOMs.&lt;/p&gt;

					<description>&lt;p&gt;Phil: the AtomAPI was promoted in the same way that Atom 0.3 was. But, really, this is just politics and misses the point.&lt;/p&gt;

					<description>&lt;p&gt;Unless you're suggesting everyone implement their own versions of the APP based on an incomplete spec (over a number of years so the implementations would not be interoperable), I'm not sure what the example of your mobile Atom client proves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, if you were being picky, you &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; say that no-one has implemented the Atom API at all.&lt;/p&gt;

					<description>&lt;p&gt;The first public implementation I did was in &lt;a href=&quot;http://franklinmint.fm/2004/09/27/mobile_atom.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;September of 2004&lt;/a&gt;. It worked with public endpoints from Blogger and Typepad.&lt;/p&gt;

					<description>&lt;p&gt;Given that the APP isn't finished off etc. isn't saying &quot;The Atom protocol ... hasn’t seen wide deployment&quot; a bit of a straw man?&lt;/p&gt;

					<description>&lt;p&gt;If Mark is right, then “high” REST is really just an extension of &lt;code&gt;POST&lt;/code&gt; vs &lt;code&gt;GET&lt;/code&gt; (already proven) to &lt;code&gt;POST&lt;/code&gt; vs all-else; that is to say, the proof is not entirely, but very nearly complete.&lt;/p&gt;

					<description>&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure what your point is. I showed that the definition of &quot;high&quot; rest has no basis in reality. so... you make the call!&lt;/p&gt;

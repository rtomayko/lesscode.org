					<description>&lt;p&gt;The funny thing here is that it must be written by someone who does not know much about neither beer nor red wine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is really hard to guess if a red wine is good. You can know the grapes, the district, the vintage etc. But the only way to actually know if a red wine is good is by tasting it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beer on the other hand has a far more predictable taste. And beer also has a far more diverse range of flavours. There are bigger taste differences between different beer types than between different wine types.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason that people drink more red wine is usually due to snobbery and lack of knowledge of beer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your judgment of beer comes from drinking Budweiser, its no wonder you think red wines are more nuanced. But try some really good beer and you will know that red wine has no advantage here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Btw. I enjoy red wine and beer equally.&lt;/p&gt;

					<description>&lt;blockquote&gt;This tends to happen frequently with your posts. Before you post something, maybe you should have a couple of friends read it and see if they grok it. It seems like when you write your articles, there’s a lot of context that you leave out and just assume that people will know. Let us in!&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry, can't do, people are always complaining that it's too verbose then.&lt;/p&gt;

					<description>&lt;p&gt;Alright! I've got something good to say about this! Drum roll...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Well at least it's not a car analogy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I have no preferences, except the ‘beer with sushi, red wine with salmon’ dictum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about sake?
(It's two questions in one!)&lt;/p&gt;

					<description>&lt;p&gt;Straw Dogs wrote:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;To lump the majority of languages into the ‘beer’ category and a selection of fine scripting languages into the white wine category only to give Ruby an entire category of its own then claim it is the finest of them all. Arrogance of the highest order.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think there's been a slight misunderstanding of my intentions. You see, I wasn't trying to say that Ruby is the finest language, or the most sophisticated, or the most elite, or the most powerful etc. All I was pointing at is that when it comes to Ruby, most developers tend to &lt;em&gt;treat it&lt;/em&gt; as if it was red wine. It is not that we, Rubyists, claim that it is like red wine. It is merely that non-Rubyists tend to view it the same way that many beer drinkers view red wine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not my fault that these people get mystified as to why would Ruby be so seductive. And it also is not an indication that I am arrogant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, don't kill the messenger:-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I hope its all ‘tongue-in-cheek’ or I may glass you with a bottle of fine white.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't glass the messenger with a bottle of fine white wine:-)&lt;/p&gt;

					<description>&lt;p&gt;I thinking of writing a paper &quot;Defining a linguistic Young's Modulus: The elastic limit for analogies&quot;. Anyone care to contribute? ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

					<description>&lt;p&gt;I would like to suggest another analogy...
I would like to make python and ruby hard liquor and php/asp etc beer. 
Then lets call getting drunk &quot;getting the job done&quot;. 
This way, php and asp might taste good, and being a beer drinker I will always favour a beer over a glass of Johnny Walker! But, making Ruby on Rails and Django tequila?! 
See where I'm going? They might not necessarily be better tasting(or they might very well be) but they get the job done quicker :-)
as would any good framework?&lt;/p&gt;

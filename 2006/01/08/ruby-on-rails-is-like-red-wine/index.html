				<p>Fifteen, twenty years ago North America was a culinary wasteland, save for the rare pockets scattered along east, west and south coasts. A brief trip to places like New Orleans would shock and jolt the palate of the plain white crustless bread, stake-and-potatoes visitors. Of course, let&#8217;s not forget other fine culinary spots, such as Manhattan, San Francisco, and several other islands in the otherwise homogenous sea of mediocrity.</p>

<p>Things started to change rapidly in the nineties, reaching levels of unprecedented sophistication in dinning and wining. Today, we can enjoy the incredibly opulent selection offered to us through stores such as <a href="http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/">The Whole Paycheck</a> (er, <a href="http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/">Whole Foods</a>), but things were drastically different only fifteen years ago.</p>

<p>I remember how unpopular wine drinking was not that long ago. Especially in my neck of the woods (I live in Vancouver, British Columbia, where most locals still mentally inhabit the 19th century time zone). Up until very recently, this was a beer country. All normal, regular males were expected to drink beer. Wine was mostly available in those hideous 4 litre carton boxes, and tasted like pee that went bad. Anyone caught preferring or, god forbid, drinking wine was declared gay on the spot. It used to be very hard to smuggle a bottle of import wine into one&#8217;s apartment.</p>

<p>At social gatherings, wine drinking was reserved for the female population. Men were either expected to chug beer, or go with some hard booze.</p>

<p>Luckily, things started changing for the better, and now we have pretty decent selection of import wines from all around the world. Plus, straight men are not afraid that they&#8217;ll be labelled as &#8216;faggots&#8217; if they are seen drinking wine in public.</p>

<h3>What Does Wine Have to Do With Ruby on Rails?</h3>

<p>Programming languages and development platforms are kind of similar to alcoholic beverages. Majority of software developers choose products that belong to the beer category. Sure, there&#8217;s plenty of variety there, but in the final analysis, it&#8217;s all beer after all. Thus programming languages such as Pascal, Perl, Java, C#, ColdFusion, PHP etc. are basically just different varieties of beer (like, dark beer, pale ale, lager, etc.) Languages such as Assembler and C are more like hard liqueurs (e.g. whiskey, tequila, vodka). Languages such as Smalltalk, Python, Lisp, are like white wine &#8212; sophisticated and enchanting.</p>

<p>Finally, languages like Ruby (with all its domain specific flavors, such as Rake and Ruby on Rails) are like red wine. Red wine is that special gamut of products that demand incredibly high level of devotion and finesse, thus creating its own breed of aficionados.</p>

<p>And like the friction that wine drinkers were having with the overruling beer crowd, Ruby and Ruby on Rails users are today experiencing similar friction coming from the &#8216;beer crowd&#8217; of programming languages. Most of the dissent seems to be coming from the &#8216;plain vanilla&#8217; lager crowd (the Java consumers). There&#8217;s also some dissent coming from the &#8216;white wine&#8217; crowd, but in a much more civilized fashion.</p>

<p>I wonder if the same cultural evolution, that helped promote the spreading of the red wine culture throughout North America, will happen for the &#8216;red wine of software development&#8217;, that is, for Ruby on Rails? At this point, it doesn&#8217;t seem very likely, as anyone who&#8217;s using Rails seems to be labelled in a knee-jerk fashion as being &#8216;queer&#8217;. It is obvious that the mainstream crowd of software developers (i.e. the beer drinking crowd) is extremely uncomfortable with the uprising of the red wine drinking crowd (i.e. the Ruby on Rails). The beer drinking crowd confesses that they simply don&#8217;t get what could possibly be so enchanting about enjoying the red wine.</p>

<p>Hopefully, cooler heads will prevail, and the medical findings that red wine is actually beneficial for one&#8217;s health will pave the way toward adopting the red wine consumption on a larger scale.</p>

			<p>I wouldn&#8217;t call myself a beer-drinking programmer but I dislike ruby b/c I think the syntax is really horrible. I&#8217;ve been using python for a number of years now and I like leaving out all the bizarro line noise and focusing on programming what I want. Ruby as a concept doesn&#8217;t bug me but the implementation drives me bonkers. </p>
<p>I think there is plenty of room for there to be people who do not like ruby but don&#8217;t object to its &#8216;philosophical&#8217; intents.</p>

			<p>Sure I like a good glass of wine, but the wine-snobs that won&#8217;t drink anything else are missing out on some great microbrews.</p>
<p>The analogy is amusing, but it doesn&#8217;t really accomplish anything.  Sure Ruby on Rails is having a major impact on web development, but acting like it has no competition is unwise.  Part of the Rails&#8217; influence has been to inspire other similar frameworks.  It&#8217;s really pushed the Python web development community to step up and offer Django and TurboGears as alternatives.  I think that having a diversity of web frameworks promotes more experimentation than when everyone is focused on the same way of doing things.  </p>
<p>Java and C# are a good example of the benefits of competition.  The Java language became quite stagnant without a major competitor, then C# came along and offered a language quite similar to Java, but fixed many of the problems that Java had.  Finally Java was forced to respond and added a bunch of these long-awaited features to Java 1.5 like generics, autoboxing, enhanced for loop, annotations; far more language features than had been developed in a long time.</p>
<p>I think that dynamic languages are going to play a very important role in the next generation of web development, but if the Rails developers pretend like in it&#8217;s a league of its own, they&#8217;ll likely ignore innovations going on in other web development communities.</p>

<p>Ah, the perennial challenge of trying to explain the joke to a person who didn&#8217;t get it. You see, this joke is funny because&#8230; You know what, on second thought I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m going to get into explaining this.

			<p>Isn&#8217;t it sad when a tiny and mostly ignored programming language suddenly gets driven by a Framework that desperatly begs to repeat the worst errors of Zope (I just say aquisition), to attract a bunch of programmers from Java and PHP?</p>
<p>No, I think it&#8217;s even more sad that proponents of the fine point of such an analogy are incapable of using the analogy for what it&#8217;s worth, namely that habits of people are not that easely tied to stuff they consume, and that the stuff they consume mostly has a wider variety then what is presented in the article.</p>
<p>No that&#8217;s not it either. I think the truely sad point all about it is the awfull reiteration of the stone-age old language-war statment &#8220;I pwn you suck because I use x and you use y&#8221;. Ohno, that&#8217;d been too simple right?</p>

			<p>Hmmm. Are we sure that wasn&#8217;t a bottle of Chateau Troll &#8216;06? I have to assume that it was&#8230;</p>
<p>I think we ought to distinguish (as others have here) between paradigm and implementation. In terms of implementation, one could for example extend the analogy - it&#8217;s easy to find somewhere out there serving beer, but trying to get your local pub to serve decent wine can be a problem. And wine does come in very much smaller glasses. If (like me) your youth was spent as a quantity over quality man, then red wine wasn&#8217;t what you needed&#8230; </p>
<p>And as an aside (oh, yes, why not, go on I&#8217;ll have another glass of Chateau Troll &#8216;06) seven-odd series of Frasier doesn&#8217;t mean that America isn&#8217;t still a culinary wasteland&#8230;</p>

			<p>Re: smugness.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been accused of being smug with this post. You may find it hard to believe, but that wasn&#8217;t really my intention.</p>
<p>I was merely reporting my findings from the field. Repeatedly, as I&#8217;m delivering Ruby on Rails presentations, or explaining to my colleagues in a less formalized environment the reasoning that is fuelling the RoR movement, I tend to get typical &#8220;I don&#8217;t get it&#8221; reactions. Most developers appear to be mystified as to what on earth could be the benefits of RoR.</p>
<p>Now, maybe that&#8217;s due to my lousy demoing skills, but I nevertheless felt tempted to draw comparisons with my attempts to introduce my friends to the benefits/charms of red wine. Most of the people I&#8217;ve had a chance to discuss red wine with tend to shrug and confess that &#8216;beer is the ticket&#8217;.</p>
<p>Things are better now than they were 15 years ago, but still beer wins hands down.</p>
<p>Likewise, most developers can&#8217;t seem to notice anything worthwhile in RoR, compared to the way they develop using (replace _blank_ with your favorite language).</p>
<p>On a personal note, I enjoy both good beer and good red wine. I have no preferences, except the &#8216;beer with sushi, red wine with salmon&#8217; dictum.</p>

			<p>[&#8230;] E&#8217; superfluo notare che Ruby on Rails sta godendo di un hype pazzesco, in alcuni casi ai limiti del fanatismo. Spesso si leggono articoli, come quello di Alex Bunardzic, che sembrano scritti tanto per fare propaganda.

			<p>I would like to suggest another analogy&#8230;<br />
I would like to make python and ruby hard liquor and php/asp etc beer.<br />
Then lets call getting drunk &#8220;getting the job done&#8221;.<br />
This way, php and asp might taste good, and being a beer drinker I will always favour a beer over a glass of Johnny Walker! But, making Ruby on Rails and Django tequila?!<br />
See where I&#8217;m going? They might not necessarily be better tasting(or they might very well be) but they get the job done quicker :-)<br />
as would any good framework?</p>

<p>I think there&#8217;s been a slight misunderstanding of my intentions. You see, I wasn&#8217;t trying to say that Ruby is the finest language, or the most sophisticated, or the most elite, or the most powerful etc. All I was pointing at is that when it comes to Ruby, most developers tend to <em>treat it</em> as if it was red wine. It is not that we, Rubyists, claim that it is like red wine. It is merely that non-Rubyists tend to view it the same way that many beer drinkers view red wine.</p>
<p>It is not my fault that these people get mystified as to why would Ruby be so seductive. And it also is not an indication that I am arrogant.</p>
<p>So, don&#8217;t kill the messenger:-)</p>

<p>This tends to happen frequently with your posts.  Before you post something, maybe you should have a couple of friends read it and see if they grok it.  It seems like when you write your articles, there&#8217;s a lot of context that you leave out and just assume that people will know.  Let us in!</p>

<p>Sorry, can&#8217;t do, people are always complaining that it&#8217;s too verbose then.</p>

			<p>The funny thing here is that it must be written by someone who does not know much about neither beer nor red wine.</p>
<p>It is really hard to guess if a red wine is good. You can know the grapes, the district, the vintage etc. But the only way to actually know if a red wine is good is by tasting it.</p>
<p>Beer on the other hand has a far more predictable taste. And beer also has a far more diverse range of flavours. There are bigger taste differences between different beer types than between different wine types.</p>
<p>The reason that people drink more red wine is usually due to snobbery and lack of knowledge of beer.</p>
<p>If your judgment of beer comes from drinking Budweiser, its no wonder you think red wines are more nuanced. But try some really good beer and you will know that red wine has no advantage here.</p>
<p>Btw. I enjoy red wine and beer equally.</p>

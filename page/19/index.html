					<p>There is an <a href="http://news.com.com/Open-source+LAMP+a+beacon+to+developers/2100-7344_3-5744767.html?tag=cd.hed" title="Open-source LAMP a beacon to developers">emerging notion</a> that there are really three
cleanly separated platforms that will be contending for the enterprise
over the next few years: Java, .NET, and LAMP/friends. Current
mainstream thinking suggests that LAMP isn&#8217;t really a contender but that
dynamic languages at least have a chance of riding in on top of the JVM
or CLR.</p>

<p>But I&#8217;d like to consider some of <a href="http://lesscode.org/2005/07/17/visual-fred/" title="Visual Fred">Sam&#8217;s findings</a> in working with
Parrot in the context of dynamic languages on the JVM or
CLR. Specifically, that using a common VM for multiple languages is
hard; and keep in mind that Sam is hacking on a VM that is <em>designed</em>
for dynamic languages, whereas the mainstream VMs are not.</p>

<p>As I was saying, initial thinking suggested that one of Jython, JRuby,
IronPython, etc. would be the horse that dynamic languages would ride
into the enterprise but I&#8217;ve grown away from this notion for a few
reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Rails is <a href="http://lesscode.org/2005/07/15/more-j2ee-vs-rails/" title="Rails Furthers Industry Acceptance">gaining acceptance</a> with hardcore Java heads under
the C Ruby implementation, not the Java Ruby implementation.</p></li>
<li><p>The LAMP stack is <a href="http://news.com.com/Open-source+LAMP+a+beacon+to+developers/2100-7344_3-5744767.html?tag=cd.hed" title="Open-source LAMP a beacon to developers">gaining acceptance</a> at a rapid pace and
in my experience, adding Java/.NET to a LAMP setup results in an
impedance mismatch both in tool simplicity and quality of license /
community.</p></li>
<li><p>The misconception that dynamic languages are useful only for
&#8220;scripting&#8221; type tasks (e.g. gluing static language code together in
controlled environments) is fading fast. It&#8217;s hard to find someone
who will argue that Python or Ruby are incapable of being used as
the <em>primary</em> language on large projects where these people were
everywhere as early as a year ago.</p></li>
<li><p>Dynamic Language to Shitty Language bridge libraries give you <a href="http://patricklogan.blogspot.com/2005/03/opposites.html">the
best of both worlds</a>: a
portable and efficient implementation of the language interpreter
plus the mass of libraries that were developed under legacy
runtimes (yes, I&#8217;m trolling now) like the JVM and CLR.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I&#8217;d much prefer to be working on the C implementations of these
languages as opposed to the mainstream VM based ones. The JVM/CLR based
implementations have problems: C extension libraries (are they even
possible?), a lag in features from their mainline counterparts, less
community involvement, and running atop mainstream VMs typically
requires more resources than running atop the C interpreters.</p>

<p>Further, Java and .NET have licensing issues that create obstacles to
adoption. The inability of Linux/BSD distributions to include the vendor
implementations is a problem that neither vendor seems to be willing to
budge on. The <a href="http://www.go-mono.com/">Mono</a> and <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/java/">GCJ</a>/<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/classpath/">GNU
Classpath</a> projects are moving
in the right direction, no doubt, but it bothers me that in the end our
best case is a situation where we&#8217;re running great languages on top of
VMs designed for poor languages and have no participation from their
original creators. That doesn&#8217;t really give me the warm and fuzzy about
the future of dynamic languages&#8230;</p>

<p>Note that <a href="http://www.parrotcode.org/">Parrot</a> is a very different
situation from the mainstream VMs. It&#8217;s being designed for dynamic
languages, is licensed for the community, and probably won&#8217;t have the
same issues with wrapping C extension libraries.</p>

<p>Getting to the point, I&#8217;d like to challenge the assumption that running
dynamic languages on mainstream VMs is optimal / desirable in the long 
term. The existing interpreters have thriving communities, years of proven use,
and a slew of C/C++ extension wrappers to even more proven
libraries. They are already cross-platform and there&#8217;s bridge code for
accessing the vast set of functionality that has been implemented in
Java or C#.</p>

<p>The real question for me becomes, when will LAMP/friends gain legitimacy
as an &#8220;enterprise class&#8221; platform and how quickly will that force the
industry to re-evaluate optimal deployment models?</p>

					<p>I&#8217;d like to advise everyone attending <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/os2005/" title="O'Reilly Open Source Convention 2005">OSCON</a> with an interest in dynamic languages 
to not miss <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/" title="Intertwingly - It's just data">Sam Ruby</a>&#8217;s <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2005/view/e_sess/6833" title="Pie-thon Update">pie-thon Update</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>OSCON 2004 was the home of the pie-thon challenge, which pitted Parrot
  against CPython on a test of speed using a bechmark that Guido van
  Rossum designed. This presentation provides an update&#8211;not only on
  performance, but also on language compatibility, as well as an outlook
  on the potentials for inter-language interop that can be acheived by a
  common language runtime for dynamic languages.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I was lucky enough to chat with Sam about this a bit and the little I
got out of him was intriguing. The blurb doesn&#8217;t go into a lot
of detail but one of things he&#8217;ll be talking about is compatibility
between dynamic languages at the runtime level. Here&#8217;s a sneak peek:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;rubys&gt;    There is a big difference between Python and
           Perl. Ruby might be someplace in between.
&lt;rtomayko&gt; that's interesting. I've been seeing reports of 
           the same thing from the CLR and JVM crowds
&lt;rubys&gt;    my favorite example: what does 
           """ print  '1' + '2'; """ do?
&lt;rtomayko&gt; ahh
&lt;rtomayko&gt; and so the strong/weak thing is down at that level?
&lt;rubys&gt;    it is not just that.  "+" is a function in Perl.  It 
           accepts two arguments which have types.  It coerces them 
           to numeric values, and adds them.
&lt;rtomayko&gt; python = '12', perl = 3, ruby = '12' (i think)
&lt;rubys&gt;    "+" is a synonym for "__add__" in Python.  It merely is 
           the name of a method.  What it does is up to the first 
           argument.
&lt;rtomayko&gt; right, I see. and so all of these languages will have 
           to shift a bit.
&lt;rubys&gt;    shifting all the language a bit is what .net did.  And 
           you end up with "Visual Fred" (look it up)
</code></pre>

<p><a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=visual+fred&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8" title="Visual Fred">Visual Fred</a> was the name proposed for Visual Basic.NET by MVPs
who quickly realized that VB.NET had nothing to do with VB due to the
syntactic and semantic changes forced on the language by the common
runtime.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>Once <a href="http://djangoproject.org/" title="Django">Django</a> is <em>launched-launched</em>, I&#8217;ll be comparing various
aspects of it with <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com/" title="Ruby on Rails">Ruby on Rails</a>. I plan on diving deep into
the two frameworks so instead of one large post, I&#8217;m going to make this
a running series.</p>

<p>While I&#8217;m primarily a Python coder, I&#8217;ve been dabbling with Ruby for
about a year and have a couple of apps under my belt with Rails. They
are admittedly simple apps but what isn&#8217;t with Rails? I&#8217;ve also logged
70-80 hours against a Python clone of Rails&#8217; excellent implementation of
Active Record, which put me pretty deep into the internals of that
piece.</p>

<p>I am not a Python zealot. And, to be honest, I&#8217;m floating between the
two languages as my primary. What I&#8217;m trying to say is that my interest
is in exploring these two frameworks objectively and extending my
understanding of each, not advocating one over the other. I will include
personal thoughts on design and may favor one or the other at this level
but I will not be concluding the series with a recommendation for either
because, frankly, I already know which I&#8217;d recommend at present and it
has nothing to do with technical qualities (hint: <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000484.html" title="Growing an open source ecosystem">it has everything to
do with this</a>).</p>

<p>That being said, I <em>can</em> recommend that if you are building systems that
require the complexity of a full-stack web framework (i.e. <a href="http://www.megginson.com/blogs/quoderat/archives/2005/06/11/rails-vs-php-mvc-or-view-centric/" title="Rails vs. PHP: MVC or view-centric">PHP, CGI
won&#8217;t cut it</a>) and you are currently using something other than one
of these two frameworks in any language (including Java and .NET) on any
platform, that you move swiftly to adopt either if possible. If there is
something barring you from making that switch, well, <a href="http://intertwingly.net/slides/2005/rs/7.html" title="Where's your patch?">where&#8217;s your
patch?</a> Make it happen.</p>

<p>I realize that many in the Python community have already grown
comfortable with an existing framework (or more likely, have written
their own, like myself) and that&#8217;s fine as there are some competent
frameworks out there. But it has become apparent that Django will be
growing a large community of contributors and that&#8217;s something no
current Python web framework of this kind can boast.</p>

<p>As I write this, there are 30 people idling in #django on
irc.freenode.net on a Sunday morning, two days after the none-launch;
there&#8217;s been <a href="http://del.icio.us/url/980ce09131008f964385d9fc6bf5c319">409 bookmarks on del.icio.us</a>.
Granted this is all very much driven by hype right now as there hasn&#8217;t
been any real experience with the framework, <a href="http://simon.incutio.com/archive/2005/07/17/django">excepting the
maintainers</a>, but
the outlook for a large community to finally coalesce around a single
set of tools and conventions is promising.</p>

<p>I also want to mention that I spent some time talking to the Django
maintainers last night and they&#8217;ve convinced me that the Rails
comparisons, while unavoidable, may be somewhat premature. Although
Django has many of the same traits as Rails, it wasn&#8217;t built as an all
out clone and may appeal to a slightly different set of
requirements. Time will tell, of course, but as of right now the
similarities are a huge part of what&#8217;s driving interest in Django and
there&#8217;s a good reason for that - Rails got a ton right.</p>

<p>Still, &#8220;because it&#8217;s in Rails&#8221; is unlikely to be considered sufficient
justification for Django feature requests. That&#8217;s a sure way of creating
a <em>Bride of Frankenstein</em> framework and I&#8217;m pleased to see the
maintainers have a strong sense of this. Django is likely to follow many
of the same paths as Rails but that&#8217;s because they were both designed
under real life circumstances with similarly excellent philosophy.</p>

<p>Before I wrap this up, I&#8217;d like to echo the sentiments of <a href="http://blog.yanime.org/articles/2005/07/16/ruby-has-rails-python-now-has-django">one Rails
supporter</a> 
in his comments on Django:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I hope Rails learns to play with Django and they&#8217;ll not smite each
  other (if not friends, don&#8217;t be enemies). The world is big enough. A
  combined message from different camps will be more resounding than any
  one camp trying to say he is the bestest - and coming off as naive or
  clueless.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Indeed.</p>

<p>(<em>warning:</em> stomach wrenching, <em>KUM BAI AH</em>, everyone-hold-hands type
stuff imminent)</p>

<p>The Ruby, Python, Perl, and PHP communities must understand the immense
opportunities that await them should they accept that they share much
more in common than not and that a unified front would go a long way in
tearing down the barriers that have kept these technologies out of the
mainstream. The amount of positive impact these disruptive technologies
could have on existing forms of business and social interaction in
general are limited only by our ability to tell the story.</p>

this years <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/os2005/" title="O'Reilly Open Source Convention 2005">OSCON</a> where <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2005/view/e_spkr/2231" title="Byron Sebastian - Source Labs">Byron Sebastian</a>, CEO and
Founder of <a href="http://www.sourcelabs.com/" title="SourceLabs">SourceLabs</a>, will go toe to toe with <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2005/view/e_spkr/2340" title="Bob Sutor - IBM Corporation">Bob
Sutor</a>, VP of Standards at IBM Corporation, on whether F/OSS is
to the Enterprise as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incas#Spanish_conquest_and_Vilcabamba">Guns were to the Incas</a>.</p>

<p>The format is interesting with Sebastian taking the extreme position of
&#8220;open source takes all&#8221; and Sutor the position of &#8220;protracted struggle
between proprietary and open source enterprise software&#8221;. It&#8217;s interesting
to note that they couldn&#8217;t find <em>anyone</em> to champion the &#8220;proprietary takes
all&#8221; scenario. </p>

<p>I&#8217;m not able to attend this years OSCON but I&#8217;m hoping this debate makes
it&#8217;s way onto <a href="http://itconversations.com">IT Conversations</a>. If anyone
attending wants to live blog the debate for lesscode.org, it would be
much appreciated.</p>

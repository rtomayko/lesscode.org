					<p>Tim Bray <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2005/07/11/New-Public-Relations">posted a
doozy</a>
a few minutes ago on the changing face of PR, analysis, and trade press:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>The Old Public Relations</strong> </p>
  
  <p>The mechanism was easy to write down, it went
  like this:</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li><p>Senior management, with a lot of input from marketing people, would
  work out a company’s message and talking points.</p></li>
  <li><p>Internal marketing people, working with PR consultants, would try to
  burn the message into the retinas of the trade press and analysts.</p></li>
  <li><p>The journalists and analysts would do what they do: the whorish
  segment of the profession regurgitating the company messages to the
  attention of very few, the independent thinkers producing
  sometimes-useful analysis of what the companies were really up to.</p></li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>It never worked that well; to start with, it was expensive and
  slow. Also, there was a huge conflict of interest: the journalists and
  analysts, who positioned themselves as independents, were in fact
  mostly on the payroll of the companies trying to push the messages.</p>
  
  <p><strong>The New Public Relations</strong></p>
  
  <p>The new PR pipeline is a lot shorter,
  simpler, and wider:</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li><p>Senior management works out a company’s goals and messages.</p></li>
  <li><p>Management works hard to make sure that the employees understand them.</p></li>
  <li><p>The people who are really doing the work tell the story to the
  world, directly.</p></li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#8217;s important to realize that this change in authority is partially
responsible for the rise of LAMP/friends as a viable platform for
building real applications. That is to say, these technologies have
<em>always</em> been a capable platform but the change in how people receive and
participate in information has allowed these technologies to step up and
finally begin claiming the problem areas they fill so well.</p>

<p>Our biggest problem is that we don&#8217;t talk loud enough.</p>

<p>As an example, would <a href="http://37signals.com">37signals</a> have been
possible even two years ago? I really don&#8217;t think so; at least, not in
its current form. As much as I love the technical and methodological
stuff those guys are pushing out, what I think is most interesting is
how well they understand The New Public Relations.</p>

					<p>What are you guys thinking about <a href="http://www.fundable.org/">Fundable.org</a>?
Newsforge has the <a href="http://business.newsforge.com/print.pl?sid=05/07/07/1330241">short and sweet</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The concept, while unique, is quite simple. Anyone who has a product
  or service to sell, or needs monetary support for a charitable cause,
  or who wants to organize a group purchase, posts their requirement on
  Fundable.org. They specify the number of contributors needed and the
  amount of money required from each. They also specify a deadline by
  which to raise the needed capital. Fundable.org holds all
  contributions until the total amount requested is received, or the
  deadline is reached. If, by the deadline, the amount contributed is
  less than the required amount, the project is scrapped and the
  contributors receive a full refund.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;ve yet to see a working method of raising money on the web for
collaborative development and I&#8217;m skeptical by default besides. That
being said, this <em>does</em> have some interesting ideas attached to it that
I&#8217;ve not seen elsewhere and sometimes a slight modification makes all the
difference.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m sorry to say that I don&#8217;t think this is going to be a revolution in
funding projects based on anonymous donation but here&#8217;s a few scenarios
where Fundable may be useful in collaborative development:</p>

<h4>User Groups</h4>

<p>I&#8217;m a member of a few local area user groups and there&#8217;s a frequent need
to raise money: food, venues, food, fix things that are broken at
people&#8217;s houses, and food.</p>

<p>Of course, telling everyone to bring $5 to the next meeting works pretty
well, too.</p>

<h4>Infrastructure</h4>

<p>Hardware and bandwidth can be had for cheap if you can find a nice
little group of people with OS and configuration tastes similar to your
own. I&#8217;d rather split up a root level, dedicated, co-located box between
5 others than deal with a shared or virtual box.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s something to try: go out and find a nice hosting plan, determine
the optimal number of people needed to get the cost down but not tax the
box, throw something up on fundable and then point people to it via
weblog. I&#8217;d think you may have a decent chance of working something out.</p>

<p>Oh well, it will be interesting to see the types of uses people put
Fundable to in the next few months.</p>

					<p>A big part of what we&#8217;re all trying to do is bring the complexity of our
systems and working environments way down compared to that of the
established industry. Complexity is a tricky concept, however, and I
believe it is wise to understand when it is and isn&#8217;t okay to play the &#8220;too complex&#8221;
card.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dehora.net/journal/2005/05/trading_off.html">Bill de hÓra</a> introduced me to the idea
that the <q>that&#8217;s not simple</q> argument is often not very different 
from the <q>that won&#8217;t scale</q> argument we&#8217;ve all come to despise:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>These days we are all complexity experts and simplicity mavens. Once
  upon a time a popular way to trash somebody&#8217;s technical design without
  having to bother to present a cogent argument was to point at it and
  say it would never scale. Today we just can call designs we don&#8217;t like
  complex - that&#8217;s even better because while it&#8217;s unlikely to happen,
  you can actually have a meaningful conversation about
  scale. Complexity on the other hand is comparatively vague - indeed
  there is only one simple definition of simplicity for software.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But <a href="http://www.megginson.com/blogs/quoderat/archives/2005/05/16/burden-of-proof/">David Meggison</a>
does an excellent job of describing why the simplicity argument is a
healthy way of thinking about systems anyway:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&#8230; it&#8217;s really a fundamental change in the burden of proof (in the
  popular sense of the obligation to defend a position). With the rise
  of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development">agile development</a>
  and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worse_is_better">worse is better</a>,
  we&#8217;ve shifted from &#8220;required until proven unnecessary&#8221; 10 years ago to
  &#8220;unnecessary until proven required&#8221; today, and I think that’s a change
  for the better — after all, if we’re uncertain either way, we might as
  well pick the option that requires less time and money. So when people
  say &#8220;the project is too complex,&#8221; what they&#8217;re really saying is &#8220;prove
  to me that these features are justified.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He goes on to talk about the relationship between &#8220;unnecessary until
proven required&#8221; and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presumption_of_innocence">The Presumption of Innocence</a>, 
which is widley considered to be an essential right of peoples belonging to 
a democratic society.</p>

<p>I propose that we adopt &#8220;unnecessary until proven required&#8221;, which is perhaps
also known as <a href="http://xp.c2.com/YouArentGonnaNeedIt.html">YAGNI</a>, as one  of the &#8220;strength traits&#8221; that help ensure the successful evolution of
a system.</p>

					<p>I just had a chance to finally listen to the <a href="http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail149.html" title="Gillmor Gang - June 18">latest Gillmor Gang</a>&#8230;</p>

<p><small>UPDATE: I goofed and ended up listening to the June 2004 episode. It&#8217;s still an excellent episode&#8211;and one I don&#8217;t remember hearing last year&#8211;but is not nearly as timely as I had thought.</small></p>

<p>&#8230; with Mitchell Kertzman, a venture capitalist
with <a href="http://www.humwin.com/">Hummer Winblad Venture Partners</a>.
He talks about an investment that&#8217;s in progress. I&#8217;m just going to dump out a whole segment 
from him because it&#8217;s great stuff:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We are actually in the process of making an investment in a company
  where open source is a key part of their plan in two ways.  The first
  is, that they are building on top of the so called &#8220;open source
  commodity stack&#8221; &#8212; that&#8217;s everything from x86 processors, to Linux
  OS, to the whole LAMP aggregation of core software stack.</p>
  
  <p>So I think one of the huge breakthroughs&#8211;I&#8217;ve been running software
  companies before I did this for 30 years&#8211;and in my experience in
  running software companies that deal in enterprise software you may
  have a product that you sell to an enterprise customer but you had to
  drag around this expensive platform with you.</p>
  
  <p>So if I want to sell my software to a customer, I might be selling
  them my software for a few hundred thousand dollars but in order to
  run it they might have to buy some expensive Sun servers and some
  Oracle databases and some application servers and the cost of that
  stack meant that you were pulling a boat anchor around with you.  The
  commodity stack, with its performance and quality these days, means
  that software companies don&#8217;t have to do that anymore. </p>
  
  <p>You don&#8217;t have to spend .5 million dollars of your first round of
  financing to buy the infrastructure you need to build and test your
  products. And it also means that you can sell your software to
  customers without the incremental costs.</p>
  
  <p>The company we&#8217;re looking at, and <em>all</em> companies we&#8217;re looking at
  now are taking advantage of the lower cost
  to market of the commodity stack.</p>
  
  <p>I think that&#8217;s a <em>huge</em> development in software..</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Money understands why <em>less code</em> is important, that&#8217;s a Good Thing,
even if you <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/entrepreneurs_angels_and_the_cost_of_launch.php">don&#8217;t think you need
it</a>.</p>

<p>Mitchell goes on to talk about why Java isn&#8217;t looking as attractive as it once
did when the hype machine was in full swing and the world was a
different place:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When I first started doing this, everyone was doing J2EE backends.
  &#8230;  We still have companies that are doing J2EE backends but the
  questions that are being asked lately are very interesting. When Java
  was first being developed, the portability of Java was a huge part of
  its attractiveness. The write-once, deploy-anywhere was extremely
  compelling. The interesting thing, if you stop and look now is that
  Linux essentially has made that, ummmm, almost moot. There are now
  really two environments: there is .NET and there is Linux. And so the
  portability of Java, since, according to Microsoft, it doesn&#8217;t have a
  place in the .NET environment, therefore if you&#8217;re non-Microsoft you
  really have one environment that you&#8217;re deploying to (if you look into
  the future). So it does raise the question of why you need to carry
  this JVM around with you if you don&#8217;t need portability.</p>
  
  <p>And then the other interesting question is that, Java was useful when,
  uhh, if you consider that multi-tier or distributed application
  architectures used to communicate essentially for years by
  communicating binary data. Today, applications are really
  communicating by passing text back and forth, you know, XML or HTML,
  and Java isn&#8217;t particularly good at text processing so there&#8217;s an
  interesting development in [looking] at the scripting languages&#8211;at the
  <q>P</q> part of LAMP - PHP, Python, Perl, which are <strong>very</strong> good at
  text handling. This company we&#8217;re investing in is taking advantage of
  that. </p>
  
  <p>So I think we&#8217;re in an interesting period of evaluation on Java.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ahh man, this whole damn episode is amazing. I&#8217;m not transcribing the
whole thing, just go <a href="http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail149.html" title="Gillmor Gang - June 18">listen to it</a>.</p>

<p>While Java has two books on top, the rest of the list shows that there&#8217;s
no lack of support for LAMPish technologies and the new set of Rails
books are likely to break through onto this list as well. So why doesn&#8217;t
the analyst coverage break down similarly? Why aren&#8217;t popular magazines
and online publications dedicating half of their content to this stuff?</p>

<p>And just for fun, let&#8217;s add the design related titles back in. How many
design people do you know that are working primarily in JSP or ASP when
they don&#8217;t absolutely have to?  My experience is that designers stay as
far away from the mess that is the current state of mainstream software
development as possible. It&#8217;s not because they don&#8217;t understand as many
developers like to assume, it&#8217;s because it&#8217;s a complete mess.</p>

<p>Attention software industry tool vendors, publications, and analyst
groups: you&#8217;re not paying attention to your developers. Please shift
your attention to the tools <em>we&#8217;ve</em> built and join us in doing something
useful. </p>

					<p>I&#8217;d like to follow up Ryan&#8217;s post with a quick note on what they call high REST. The definition seems to be using GET/POST/PUT/DELETE. Those are the four significant methods in RFC2616, but every other version of HTTP has contained additional methods, and there are no widely deployed applications that operate that way. WebDAV is a bad example, since it doesn&#8217;t use POST, and defines many additional methods. LOCK, COPY, MOVE, and other methods are required to make it a useful protocol. The Atom protocol uses only those four methods, but it hasn&#8217;t seen wide deployment (though it may).</p>

<p><img src="http://lesscode.org/wp-content/uploads/2006/03/c3po3.jpg" alt="" title="C-3PO" /></p>

<p>This reality sort of pokes a hole in the argument that &#8220;high REST&#8221; standardizes what is already known to work. That doesn&#8217;t mean it won&#8217;t work, but GET/POST/PUT/DELETE advocates who claim they are pointing out the obvious are actually making a religious argument, and that poor thesis is playing the role of C-3PO in the Ewok village. It&#8217;s unproven technology, and it should be viewed with healthy skepticism.</p>

					<p>Discussion on REST seems to be moving in a constructive direction all
over the place with <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2006/03/16/WS-Gartner">Tim Bray</a> 
and <a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/dbox/archive/2006/03/18/20235.aspx">Don Box</a>
both contributing. I think <a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=83ec4876-7578-418c-8335-a3b0a147037b" title="Building a New Web Service at Google">Dare Obasanjo&#8217;s notes</a> from <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:9oV3TSIAzsEJ:buzz.blogger.com/media/minar-etech-2005.ppt+high-rest&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=3">a talk</a> given by Google&#8217;s
<a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/et2005/view/e_spkr/555">Nelson Minar</a>
almost a year ago may have put some valuable terminology behind ideas that
have been floating around for some time and may have even brought us to a place where we can have an actual conversation about this stuff:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To begin he defined what he called &#8216;low REST&#8217; (i.e. Plain Old XML over
  HTTP or POX) and &#8216;high REST&#8217;. Low REST implies using HTTP GETs for all
  API accesses but remembering that GET requests should not have side
  effects. High REST involves using the four main HTTP verbs (GET, POST,
  PUT, and DELETE) to manipulate resource representations, using XML
  documents as message payloads, putting metadata in HTTP headers and
  using URLs meaningfully.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The definitions of low REST / high REST could be tweaked a bit (maybe they were when I wasn&#8217;t looking?)
but I do like the idea of putting terms we can all agree on to the
subset that&#8217;s the reality behind most of machine/web interfaces that
seem to be working today. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_Old_XML">POX</a> 
isn&#8217;t that term because it unnessarily constrains the media type; &#8220;low REST&#8221; 
should include the mostly non-XML web (i.e. the <code>text/html</code>, <code>image/*</code>,
<code>text/css</code>, <code>text/javascript</code>, etc. web) where it conforms to the
constraints of GET and POST.</p>

<p>The reason I like this approach is because it could remove the
artificial and often harmful separation made between the web <em>people</em>
interact with and the web <em>machines</em> interact with. Exposing resources for
machine consumption isn&#8217;t any different than exposing resources for
human consumption until you get down to the media type (and not
then if you subscribe to <a href="http://microformats.org/">Microformats</a>). 
That is, some form of hyper-media (links / URIs) and a simple, universal 
interface (HTTP) are the really big wins you get with REST because those 
things are what creates the possibility of having a hugely distributed and 
uncoordinated system of interaction. The choice of document format is 
something else entirely and the decisions there ought to be based on a 
whole other set of concerns.</p>

<p>If I cared at all about the term anymore, I would go so far as to say
that anything conforming to the constraints of at least one HTTP method
and that also exposes references to other resources using URIs should be
considered &#8220;a web service&#8221;. But &#8220;web service&#8221; has been defined to death and
it doesn&#8217;t seem to be helping.</p>

<p>The first time I heard someone attempt to describe the GET/POST
subset as something we should pay attention to was 
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/mikechampion/">Michael Champion</a> on xml-dev. This was
usually thrown out when someone championing REST used the &#8220;REST is the
web and the web is working&#8221; argument (I use that argument to this day,
btw). Michael would often be the one to point out that it wasn&#8217;t <em>exactly</em> 
true and that a subset of what REST describes seemed to be working well on 
the web (GET/POST, URIs, caching), while another subset was 
clearly&mdash;sometimes knowingly&mdash;being violated (GET w/ side-effects, uncool URIs), 
and yet another subset was used only rarely (PUT/DELETE/OPTIONS, content
negotiation).</p>

<p>Not being able to distinguish which of these subsets of applied REST one
is refering to is hurting our ability to have meaningful conversations
about this stuff. For example, consider the following conversation; I&#8217;ve
seen it hundreds of times now:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><cite>Restafarian</cite>: 80% of developers use the XXX REST API because 
  they find it easier to deal with.<br />
  <cite>Tool Vendor</cite>: That&#8217;s not really REST. It only uses GET and POST and breaks rule #5034<br />
  <cite>Restafarian</cite>: Oh yea, well SOAP/WS-* sucks.<br />
  <cite>Tool Vendor</cite>: Go write some PHP you dirty hippie!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;d like that to stop happening.</p>

<p>But I don&#8217;t think adopting wrong or ambiguous terminology is going to
help either. I&#8217;d like to register my nits with the few sentences that
Dare provided and see if anyone else is thinking along similar lines.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To begin he defined what he called &#8216;low REST&#8217; (i.e. Plain Old XML over
  HTTP or POX) and &#8216;high REST&#8217;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Like I said before, POX is kind of, ummm, bad, I think. It focuses too much 
on the format. XML is not why the web is working. URLs and HTTP is
why the web is working. HTTP and URLs work so well they&#8217;re even capable
of being useful <em>in spite of</em> complexities in media-types based on XML.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Low REST implies using HTTP GETs for all API accesses but remembering
  that GET requests should not have side effects.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fully constrained GETs are really important but POST should fall under
low-REST too. By the definition above, low-REST can never modify
anything. Throw POST in there, it&#8217;s a big part of the present day
human/web and is likely to play a bigger role in the machine/web.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>High REST involves using the four main HTTP verbs (GET, POST,
  PUT, and DELETE) to manipulate resource representations, using XML
  documents as message payloads, putting metadata in HTTP headers and
  using URLs meaningfully.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think we ought to downgrade XML to a &#8220;<del>best</del><ins>common</ins>
practice&#8221; or something.  Microformats and JSON are two notable examples
of non-XML representations that seem to be working quite well and are
absolutely capable of being used high-RESTfully.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure I&#8217;ll always be a high-RESTafarian but I could definitely
see myself <a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/dbox/archive/2006/03/18/20246.aspx">coming out as a lo-RESTafarian</a>
as well if some of this were grinded out a bit more.</p>

					<p>SYS-CON Media publisher/editor <a href="http://java.sys-con.com/author/3geelan.htm" title="Jeremy Geelan">Jeremy Geelan</a>, a fine chap who
interviewed The Father of Java just the other day, contacted me about
re-publishing <a href="http://lesscode.org/2006/03/12/someone-tell-gosling/">Gosling Didn&#8217;t Get The Memo</a>
on <a href="http://sys-con.com">sys-con.com</a>. This is the same site that 
published <a href="http://java.sys-con.com/read/193146.htm">Gosling&#8217;s original remarks</a>. </p>

<p>It took me about five seconds to agree, within an hour we were
sharing the front page with the original Gosling quote, and we&#8217;ve 
just now broken into the top three most heavily read articles on the site 
for the day. <a href="http://au.sys-con.com/read/195198.htm">The republished post is here</a> and 
is pretty much an exact copy (comments and all).</p>

<p>So yea, I&#8217;m stoked.</p>

<p>I should also mention that there was likely some back-channel
prodding that helped lead to this. Adaptive Path&#8217;s <a href="http://blog.jjg.net/" title="Jesse James Garrett">Jesse James Garrett</a> 
was panelist at the SYS-CON hosted <em>Real-World AJAX</em> event earlier 
this week in New York (see: <a href="http://tv.sys-con.com/read/195160.htm">Geelan interviews Jesse</a>).
From what I can gather, Jesse played no small part in getting the article
picked up.</p>

<p>Huge thanks to both Jesse and Jeremy from lesscode.org.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>I&#8217;ve been actively developing software for the past 17 - 18 years. When I began, back in 1987, the recommended language of choice was C. The rationale at that time being that C is a language that closely and faithfully mimics the inner workings of the underlying low level machinery.</p>

<p>Obsession with the infrastructure. Yes, computing infrastructure is fascinating. But what is a computer?</p>

<h3>Mainframe is the Computer</h3>

<p>If you asked IBM 20 years ago what is a computer, they&#8217;d tell you that the mainframe is the computer. They were selling mainframes at that time, and to them every problem looked like a nail.</p>

<h3>Network is the Computer</h3>

<p>At around the same time, Sun Microsystems attempted to take over the world with their slogan &#8220;Network is the computer&#8221;. The exact opposite of mainframes. Great.</p>

<h3>Database is the Computer</h3>

<p>Also, another big-ass vendor, Oracle, had to make an attempt to take over the world with their vision of a database being the computer. Yes, databases are fun.</p>

<h3>Desktop is the Computer</h3>

<p>Finally, Microsoft took a swing at it by announcing that desktop is the king. Yes, desktop is so cool, so sexy. And, as it became more and more affordable, it really started taking over the world by the storm.</p>

<h3>Who cares?</h3>

<p>Really, honestly, who cares? Why should we care? Why should we act as foot soldiers (unpaid foot soldiers, mind you) for those vendors? It&#8217;s like us paying them to bombard us with their advertising.</p>

<p>I must say that I&#8217;m at a loss when it comes to why are we, 20 years after these ugly vendor wards started raging, still caught in the debate. What&#8217;s in it for us? Yes, we all understand what&#8217;s in it for the vendors. But, why should we care about helping them see that their definition, their slogan wins?</p>

<p>It&#8217;s like getting caught in trying to define what is electricity. The producers of electric power claim that electricity is turbines that generate it. The producers of copper wires claim that electricity is wires. The producers of light bulbs claim that electricity is the end-point, the light bulbs that deliver incandescent light to our homes.</p>

<p>But do we, as consumers, care whose vision wins? No. All we care for is that when we turn the switch on, the room gets filled with light.</p>

<h3>Who is Serving Whom?</h3>

<p>My understanding has always been that we have invented computers to serve us. Now I see that all we&#8217;re doing is expending inordinate amounts of time serving them. I don&#8217;t see any justification for why this should be so, and I therefore proclaim here that it&#8217;s high time that we cease and desists and insist that all this computing infrastructure start serving our needs.</p>

<p>But in order for that to happen, we first must stop obsessing about the computing infrastructure. It&#8217;s about time we get over it.</p>

<h3>Applications are Infrastructure</h3>

<p>Just so that we&#8217;re clear on what encompasses the computing infrastructure, I&#8217;d like to point out here that it&#8217;s not only about the hardware and the middleware and the operating systems, databases, and frameworks. Application software also counts.</p>

<p>We all know how much we tend to obsess about the applications. Many of us find a number of software applications fascinating. Well, snap out of it! Stop serving your favorite applications, and start looking into how to make those applications serve you.</p>

<p>You should start looking at applications as being a kind of anomaly, a necessary evil produced out of dire necessity in the attempt to cover the gaping holes in the existing computing machinery. Applications are superfluous, and will eventually recede into the background. Today, they hold the center stage, and many people obsess about them. But that is bound to change.</p>

<p>Once we grow up and stop obsessing over the infrastructure, we&#8217;ll finally be ready to embrace the wonderful world of computing on our own terms. This is similar to how we had to grow up and embrace the wonderful world of printed word. It wasn&#8217;t easy, and it took some serious schooling, but eventually we managed to pull it off.</p>

<p>Yes, there are still pockets of illiteracy even among the most developed countries, but these are negligible compared to the overwhelming literacy that is now the cornerstone of our culture.</p>

<a href="http://www.cincomsmalltalk.com/blog/blogView">James</a> and <em>many</em> other 
extremely talented programmers dismantle all the common hollow arguments 
for superfluous complexity and replace them with simple methodologies 
and <em>working code</em>, after all that I just figured there wasn&#8217;t much
to do around here.</p>

<p>But I completely forgot about <a href="http://java.sys-con.com/read/193146.htm">James Gosling</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&#8220;There have been a number of language[s] coming up lately,&#8221; noted 
  James Gosling today at Sun&#8217;s World Wide Education &amp; Research Conference 
  in New York City when asked if Java was in any kind of danger from the 
  newcomers. &#8220;PHP and Ruby are perfectly fine systems,&#8221; he continued, 
  &#8220;but they are scripting languages and get their power through 
  specialization: they just generate web pages. But none of them attempt 
  any serious breadth in the application domain and they both have really 
  serious scaling and performance problems.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We&#8217;ll get back to that in a second.</p>

<p>I believe that a majority of people in IT now consider dynamic languages
like Perl, Ruby, Python, and PHP to be very much capable of sitting at
the table with Java and .NET for a wide range of common technical
problems.  Similarly, straight-forward systems like REST, Microformats,
and Atom are generally considered legitimate alternatives to the
vendor/analyst/press peddled technologies like WS-* for a wide range of
integration issues. In other words, I could walk into most shops during
a technology evaluation and put these technologies on the table as
legitimate considerations without being too worried about being laughed
out of the room. This is not to claim superiority for a given task, just
that the competitive playing field is beginning to level off.</p>

<p>This was not the case last year at this time, so what happened?
Something must have changed. None of these technologies underwent huge feature or stability increases in the past year. I&#8217;m unaware of any
breakthrough in scaling these systems past what they&#8217;re already capable
of. There have been some improvements in running dynamic languages on
the mainstream VMs, which many predicted would lead to quick acceptance,
but that&#8217;s not it either. So what changed?</p>

<p>Minds changed. Respectful debate, honesty, passion, and working systems
created an environment that not even the most die-hard enterprise
architect could ignore, no matter how buried in Java design
patterns. Those who placed technical excellence and pragmaticism above
religious attachment and vendor cronyism were easily convinced of the
benefits that broadening their definition of acceptable technologies
could bring.</p>

<p>The people who are still unconvinced are those that just don&#8217;t care or
are too lazy to spend a small amount of time researching and validating
the arguments, which brings us back nicely to James Gosling&#8217;s recent
statements.</p>

<h3>On The Current Quantity of Language</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>&#8220;There have been a number of language[s]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This part is notable because it&#8217;s actually true. There have, in fact,
been <em>some</em> number of languages. While I stand steadfastly by James&#8217;
analysis of the current quantity of language, we will quickly diverge in
opinion from here.</p>

<p>A quick note to aspiring Java pundits: play close attention to the next
few statements. While none of them have any basis in reality, they have
proven sufficient in creating fear and uncertainty in the minds of those
who are evaluating these technologies.</p>

<h3>On &#8220;Scripting Languages&#8221;</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>&#8220;PHP and Ruby are perfectly fine systems,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;but they are
  scripting languages</p>
</blockquote>

<p>James pulled this directly out of &#8220;Effective Java Advocacy Beans&#8221;, section 6.8.3 
&#8220;Dealing with questions on dynamic languages&#8221;:</p>

<p><cite>First, call anything not statically compiled a &#8220;scripting
language&#8221;. Attempt to insinuate that all languages without an explicit
compilation step are not to be taken seriously and that they are all
equivalently shitty. Best results are achieved when you provide no
further explanation of the pros and cons of static and dynamic
compilation and/or typing and instead allow the reader to simply assume
that there are a wealth of benefits and very few, if any, disadvantages
to static compilation. While the benefits of dynamic languages&#8211;first
realized millions of years ago in LISP and Smalltalk&#8211;are well
understood in academia, IT managers and Sun certified developers are
perfectly accepting of our static = professional / dynamic = amateurish
labeling scheme.</cite></p>

<p><cite>This technique is also known to result in dynamic language advocates
going absolute bat-shit crazy and making complete fools of themselves.
There have been no fewer than three head explosions recorded as a result
of this technique.</cite></p>

<p><cite>Also, avoid the term &#8220;dynamic language&#8221; at all cost. It&#8217;s important that
the reader not be exposed to the concepts separating <strong>scripting languages</strong>
like bash, MS-DOS batch, and perl-in-the-eighties from
general purpose <strong>dynamic languages</strong> like Ruby, Python, Smalltalk, and
Perl present day.</cite></p>

<p>We&#8217;ve tried our best to clear up any ambiguity related to the term
&#8220;scripting language&#8221; in the past:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_language#General-purpose_dynamic_languages">Wikipedia: Scripting Language</a>
describes the difference between specialized scripting languages and general
purpose dynamic languages.</li>

<h3>On &#8220;They Just Generate Web Pages&#8221;</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>and get their power through specialization: they just generate web
  pages. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Gosling shows his ignorance regarding the current feature set provided by 
dynamic languages and what people are using them for. A cursory glance over
<a href="http://rubyforge.org/softwaremap/trove_list.php">rubyforge.org&#8217;s project tree</a>
reveals that the number of projects that &#8220;just generate web pages&#8221; are really
quite small: 151 of 1,342 total projects are registered under 
<a href="http://rubyforge.org/softwaremap/trove_list.php?form_cat=96">Internet::WWW/HTTP::Dynamic Content</a>
and many of those projects are related to using the web (HTTP/URIs) as a 
platform for integration more than they are for &#8220;generating web pages&#8221;. I 
expect Perl and Python break down even wider.  </p>

<p><em>Update</em>: Seo Sanghyeon provides <a href="http://lesscode.org/2006/03/12/someone-tell-gosling/#comment-1171">a list of popular Python related applications</a> that have nothing to do with generating web content.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d also like to note that exposing resource representations via
HTTP/URLs has been moving into areas other than &#8220;generating web pages&#8221;.
This was the plan when HTTP was originally designed but has only
recently begun to really catch on. Specialization and enhanced
capabilities related to generating and serving hyper-media over HTTP are
and will continue to increase in value. The web server is becoming a key
piece of integration infrastructure. What James refers to as &#8220;generating
web pages&#8221; is now a general purpose technique for exposing resources to
anything outside of the application process.</p>

<h3>On &#8220;breadth of application domain&#8221;</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>But none of them attempt any serious breadth in the application
  domain </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#8217;s hard to determine what kind of breadth is missing when you
consider the capabilities provided by modern dynamic language
environments, the platforms they run on, and the extensions and bridges
that allow them to use damn near any other program or library
available. James uses the example of &#8220;interplanetary navigation&#8221;, which is
a really good example except that it isn&#8217;t; most of us aren&#8217;t working at
NASA and those of us who are working at NASA are doing things like
trying to get the payroll and accounting systems working together or
building simple productivity applications. Gosling seems bent on meeting
the needs of the 20% while leaving the 80% with a platform that&#8217;s
<a href="http://www.jroller.com/page/obie?entry=productivity_arbitrage">losing bids to dynamic/agile shops</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000571.html">&#8220;That&#8217;s the kind of power I do not envy&#8221;</a>.</p>

<p>Lastly, <a href="http://peteryared.blogspot.com/">Peter Yared</a> (former Sun hacker)
and the rest of the folks over at <a href="http://www.activegrid.com/">ActiveGrid</a> 
should also be interested to learn that no one is attempting to widen the
viability of dynamic languages in the &#8220;application domain&#8221;.</p>

<h3>On Scaling and Performance</h3>

  <p>and they both have really serious scaling and performance problems.</p>

</ul>

<p>All we&#8217;re asking is that you stop spreading misinformation about the
current state of dynamic languages to the press, analysts, and your
customers. This does not require you to champion or otherwise support
these technologies – just stop lying about them. One year ago, this type
of behavior could be attributed to a lack of documentation and
discussion on these issues, today it&#8217;s impossible to attribute to
anything but malice.</p>

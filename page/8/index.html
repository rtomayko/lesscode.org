				<div class="entry">
					<p>There is a great post by Harry Pierson over at his <a href="http://devhawk.net/CommentView,guid,7d6d6cb2-2300-4e39-8ad8-a2910d81d498.aspx">DevHawk blog site</a> describing  “what can we learn from looking at the success of mainstream text-based programming languages to help us in the development of higher abstraction modeling languages that are actually useful.”</p>

<p>As I have written elsewhere, I am a huge fan of <a href="http://softwareindustrialization.com/DisplayPost.aspx?PostID=17">raising the level of abstraction</a> to deal with complexity in our software world.  This is part of what I call the industrialization of software.  No, I don’t mean making programming fully automatic, as it will never be that way.  It is too large and complex to do so.  However, I am probably as frustrated as <a href="http://minimsft.blogspot.com/">Mini-Microsoft’s</a> quest to make Microsoft a leaner meaner machine in my quest to make software development more of a predictable and repeatable process.  It seemingly ain’t going to happen over night and may not happen in my lifetime!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/autofile/www/chapter2_108.html#SECTION001080000000000000000">John Walker</a>, figured out the industrialization of the engineering design world when his invention, AutoCAD hit the market in 1982.  He said, “if you can’t model it, you can’t build it”.  Damn right!  In 2005 and in the software industry, we still have not figured it out, yet.  We are still bashing away with the stone age equivalent of hammers and chisels, whereas the engineering design world has AutoCAD to describe incredibly large and complex building structures, airplanes, engines, electronic circuit diagrams and just about everything else you can think of by modeling blueprints that are meaningful. People use these blueprints to turn models into real world constructs that you and I use every day.  How about that cell phone?  Or your iPOD? Or your car? Or that plane you just flew in on? Or <a href="http://softwareindustrialization.com/electricitytrain.htm">this</a>?</p>

<p>So what’s up with our software world?  Why do we refuse to adapt the successes of other industries, like the engineering design world, and leverage those successes in our software world?  What are we afraid of? Why are we stuck using (still) low level programming languages that we toil with at all hours of the day and night to produce inferior software products?  If we were designing and constructing commodity cars by hand and even fabricating the tools used to build the cars by hand, we would be laughed out of the industry.  How come software development seems to be different?  Where is our <a href="http://softwareindustrialization.com/DisplayPost.aspx?PostID=8">AutoCAD</a> for software development?</p>

<p>This may seem like a bit of a rant or maybe I have unrealistic expectations as to the maturity level of our software industry.  However, I still can’t believe, yours truly after being in the software development business for 15 years, still have to manually add an imports or using source code statement every time I add a reference to an assembly in Visual Studio.  What the ??  Not that I am picking on Visual Studio – I happen to think it is an excellent IDE along with introducing <a href="http://softwareindustrialization.com/DisplayPost.aspx?PostID=22">Software Factories</a>, <a href="http://softwareindustrialization.com/DisplayPost.aspx?PostID=38">Domain Specific Languages</a>, Guidance Automation Toolkits, etc.  While these tools and processes are definitely raising the level of abstraction in dealing with software complexity and advancing the industrialization of software, it still seems not enough to me.  We still lack standards like in the electronics design world for plug and play integrated circuits that I can order from a catalog. Or even standard electronic diagram symbols that describe everything electronic in which anyone trained in the industry can glean, in moments, what the circuit diagram is saying, with no ambiguity.  Are we there yet in our software world?</p>

<p>Moreover, we still have a world of programmers that refuse to even consider modeling as a first class software artifact – they consider it pretty pictures.  I know we have had issues in the past with CASE tools and with earlier versions of UML and other code generation tools.  But, I have software developers that I have worked with that won’t even give it a thought – they immediately get out their favorite source code editor and start writing code - so much for design.  And it seems the younger they are, the more I see this behavior or even the old school guys who have become “code crafters” where they take their craft extremely seriously and are totally affronted in the thought of using a “modeling” tool.  I am not sure I understand either group’s motivation for this behavior.  Where did it come from?  How come I (and a few others) don’t have this behavior?</p>

<p>What’s my point?  I don’t have one – I am just pondering, out loud, what it is going to take to bring the industrialization of software into reality – and how long?</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>Greetings fellow lesscode advocates. For those of you who don&#8217;t know <a href="http://www.redmonk.com/sogrady">me</a>, I&#8217;m an industry analyst with RedMonk, and as a couple of the folks here can probably attest, I take every opportunity to push your message and your values on an unsuspecting population of software vendor customers. Ryan&#8217;s been gracious enough to grant me the virtual floor as it were to speak to all of you today to request some assistance. </p>

<p>I&#8217;m the process of finalizing my keynote presentation for next week&#8217;s Zend/PHP conference entitled, conveniently enough, &#8220;PHP: Simplicity and Lesscode.&#8221; So here&#8217;s where I need some help, if you&#8217;re willing. My slides are trying to emphasize the role simplicity/lesscode play in all of our lives: both in technology and not. The deck currently starts from non-technology examples such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_machines">simple machines</a> and builds to technology related examples, most of which are PHP centric for reasons that are probably pretty clear. </p>

<p>The question I have for all of you then is this: what examples - real world or technology related - might you use if you were trying to evangelize the twin values of s/l? What would/do you tell people that don&#8217;t get what lesscode is all about? As an example of the type of thing I&#8217;m looking for, I&#8217;m planning on opening with one of my favorite comp-sci stories of all time: Ryan&#8217;s <a href="http://naeblis.cx/rtomayko/2005/04/02/insects-and-entropy">Insects and Entropy</a>.  Adam Bosworth&#8217;s discussion of how Google uses the stupidest query language ever is also in there. </p>

<p>Hopefully those will give you an idea of the kind of things I&#8217;m looking for, and suggestions in any form would be appreciated. I can&#8217;t promise to use everything, but I&#8217;ll incorporate whatever I think I can fit in. </p>

<p>A couple of logistical notes: </p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Slides</strong>: will be made available following the conference under Creative Commons terms on my site, and here if the community here so desires. They&#8217;ll be offered under the same terms </li>
<li><strong>Credit</strong>: will be given whenever possible during the presentation, and the closing page of the slides will contain the names of everyone whose contribution was included (so if you leave a comment, be sure that&#8217;s the name you&#8217;d like to have credited). That slide will also include a link to this entry, so that even suggestions that don&#8217;t make the deck may get some airtime.</li>
<li><strong>Technology</strong>: given that this is a PHP conference, I&#8217;m probably not going to go in depth on Python, Ruby as much as I or some of you might like. So language specific examples will likely be genericized, just as an FYI, unless they compare more complex languages to PHP - in which case they&#8217;re encouraged. </li>
<li><strong>Questions</strong>: drop them here, and I&#8217;ll do my best to answer them.</li>
</ol>

<p>Thanks for helping me get the lesscode message out, and I look forward to any conributions you might have. </p>

					<p>Apologies for dragging this corpse into the discussion again, but some latest development prompted me to try and share this with others.</p>

<p>Whenever I give presentations on Ruby and Rails, the number one question invariably pops up from the audience: will it scale?</p>

<p>At first, I was allowing myself to fall prey and to drop down into the detailed and quite meaningless discussion. But then I&#8217;ve changed the tactics, and began countering the question with: &#8220;Scale to what?&#8221;</p>

<p>Amazingly, most people don&#8217;t know the answer to that question. They just throw in abstract answers, like to thousands simultaneous requests, etc. But pretty much no one can supply a real life example that is more concrete than the yahoo or amazon or google. In other words, it seems that not too many people are working on the super busy web applications.</p>

<p>If that&#8217;s the case, the scalability question is, in most situations, quite moot.</p>

<p>But the real change in the scalability landscape is now dawning with the advent of the rich internet applications. Here is how it goes:</p>

<p>Originally, when we&#8217;ve made the transition from fat clients in the client/server world to dumb terminals (i.e. HTML documents rendered in the browser) living in the web 1.0 world, we&#8217;ve effectivelly sucked all life out of the clients. The clients got demoted to stupid braindead appliances for rendering HTML.</p>

<p>But someone had to continue doing their work. That someone was the app servers. The central role of the app servers (such as WebLogic, WebSphere, etc.) was impersonating numerous clients out there. The app servers had to do incredible amount of work impersonating the clients who were only known via their requests peppered with some cookies.</p>

<p>This situation resulted in incredible strain placed on the app servers. The whole multi-million (or is it billion?) dollars industry sprang around those beasts, and new careers were forged around WebLogic, WebSphere, JBoss etc. servers.</p>

<p>Seeing how huge the burden of impersonating numerous clients on the app server is, the question of scalability became one of the central issues.</p>

<p>However, now that the clients are finally reclaiming their state, and that the app servers do not have to continue impersonating each and every client, the whole scalability issue becomes meaningless. Let the clients do all the processing that governs their behavior. Suddenly, app servers are left with very little to do. And as the clients are happily humming and taking care of their own state, all that the back-end resources need to worry about is the centralized business logic. And in that arena, there is very little scalability issues.</p>

<p>So, now this whole topic is even more of a moot point. It&#8217;s time we gave it a decent burial, and moved on to the greener pastures.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>Once again, I need to branch out into a new thread, for the benefit of bringing to everyone&#8217;s attention the importance of the legacy stuff. Here is what Kevin Smith wrote in response to my post <a href="http://lesscode.org/2005/10/02/shared-data-and-mobile-data/">Shared Data And Mobile Data</a>:</p>

<blockquote>Alex, I completely agree with you, but one big obstacle is legacy stuff: Legacy apps which already have data in rdbms’s. Legacy code. Legacy coding patterns. Legacy frameworks. Traditionally, exchanging data has been quite difficult.</blockquote>

<p>True. I read somewhere that the data that was collected from the Moon back in the late sixties is unusuable today, because we lost the hardware that could replay them. Urban legend?</p>

<blockquote>Beyond that, if you expose an rdbms today, people can immediately generate useful and productive reports from it. They can query it. With a custom app that is “willing to” exchange data, there’s a steeper curve for other apps, and unless you have pre-exposed all your data through published api’s, you’ll have to keep extending your code to meet the data exchange needs of other apps. So with today’s technologies and patterns, there are some immediate benefits of the “data is shared” model.</blockquote>

<p>This is also true. However, since legacy systems are preponderantly bureaucratic, they should be viewed as such &#8212; they are huge bureucracies. And also, we should treat them as such and approach them as such.</p>

<p>What do we mean by that? Well, same as in real world, bureaucratic systems need to be approached prudently, or elase nothing ever gets done.</p>

<p>If I want to renew my passport, for example, there is presently no other way for me to do it but to approach the bureaucratic system that is called the Government Passport Office. And that system is very finicky (as most of you probably know first hand). So, it is quite clear to me that I need to play by their rules if I were to ever get a valid passport.</p>

<p>Now, in order for me to engage in a dialog with the Passport Office, I need to learn their lingo. In other words, I need to get all those forms, study them, make sure I go to the authorized photographer who will make me a kosher passport photo with a neat little dated stamp at the back. I also need to find me a judge, or a high school principal, or a university professor, etc., someone from those professions who claims to know me for more than 5 years. That person will be my guarantor. And on and on&#8230;.</p>

<p>Once I&#8217;ve completed all my legwork, I submit my passport application to the office.</p>

<p>At no point during this process is the Passport Office going to open up its bowels and let me query its state. I can only engage in a conversation with it through a very tight protocol.</p>

<p>We must approach software legacy systems in the same fashion. Treat them as first class citizens (which they are), and learn their lingo. Not naively expect that we could put our diving suit on and jump in and start querying and interrogating the bowels of a first class citizen.</p>

<p>There is (or should be) a protocol specifying how we can talk to the first class citizens, or bureaucratic systems. If we learn how to compose the complex messages they expect us to give them, we can get exactly what we&#8217;re looking for from them.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t see absolutely any need for us to assume that the information we&#8217;re looking to get from the bureaucratic systems is stored in an RDBMS. Consequently, SQL should not necessarily be our <i>lingua franca</i> when conversing with legacy systems.</p>

<blockquote>Many developers are so immersed in rdbms’s that they don’t even realize that the concepts of data storage and data exchange are separable. I figure we’re at least a few years away from the point that your “data is mobile” idea is widely accepted in by mainstream (especially corporate) developers.</blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;m not sure that I agree. I see a big push towards SOA, which is exactly what I&#8217;ve described above. The mainstream businesses have realized that only if they place their legacy systems in a role of being first class citizens do they have a chance to play in the 21st century economy.</p>

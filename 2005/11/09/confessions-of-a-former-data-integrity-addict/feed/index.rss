  &lt;p&gt;P.S. Is there any reason why you only read the first sentence and then stop and ask the question?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read it, don't worry. I just didn't comment on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Alex, you’re assuming we aren’t already subscribed.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for the pointers, Bill. At this stage, I'm still waking up from the 'vendorized' dogmatic slumber. Similar to that classic scene in the &quot;Matrix 1&quot; movie, when Neo wakes up inside a huge human farm, I see many of my colleagues ensnared by the vendor-based technology, not wanting to be disturbed nor talked to (at all).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now I'm rambling around, wondering how to spread the word. I still don't understand all the mechanisms of the free world. Thanks for shedding the light on some of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how can I know who's already subscribed?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I heard you made it onto Fabian’s debunkings site tho’ - if that’s true, kudos :)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another example of my appalling ignorance. Who's Fabian and what's the debunking site? And why kudos?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;If it doesn’t relate, then why even meantion it here?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read the next sentence in my post (the one immediately following the sentence you've quoted), in there you'll find the answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S. Is there any reason why you only read the first sentence and then stop and ask the question?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I have been writing a lot lately about the role of RDBMSs in the software design, something I don’t think relates all that much to the practice of lesscode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it doesn't relate, then why even meantion it here?&lt;/p&gt;

					<description>&lt;p&gt;&quot;...but wanted only to give heads-up to the database-centric lesscoders&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alex, you're assuming we aren't already subscribed. At this stage I'd say anyone who has been following your writing here and is interested in what you have to say is subscribed. Blog link mechanics don't require you to relink, and selfishly speaking I'd suggest it's a bad idea - because I'm seeing this piece come through at least twice now. Also, you might run into a perception issue - insofar it's more compelling when someone else links to me than when I do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I heard you made it onto Fabian's debunkings site tho' - if that's true,  kudos :)&lt;/p&gt;

					<description>&lt;p&gt;I have been writing a lot lately about the role of RDBMSs in the software design, something I don't think relates all that much to the practice of lesscode. But the several earlier posts on that topic that I've presented here generated a lot of heated interest by the rather nervous database crowd. I didn't feel like clogging the lesscode space with irrelevant database posts, but wanted only to give heads-up to the database-centric lesscoders.&lt;/p&gt;

			<div class="entrytext">
				<p>You may have noticed posts by a few really really smart individuals here
over the past weeks. I feel like I should explain what&#8217;s going on and
attempt a basic description of what I hope lesscode.org might
become. Keep in mind that this is all very much a pipe-dream at this
point.</p>

<p>About a month ago I sent an invitation to a handful of people that I
feel have an excellent grasp on the history and potential of the web and
IT in general and invited them to post here (I don&#8217;t feel comfortable
listing names because I don&#8217;t want to get everyone&#8217;s hopes up). The
list was small but the group covered an insane amount of expertise in
technologies like PHP, Python, Perl, Ruby, Rails, Apache, HTTP, Web
Architecture, XML, AJAX, Microformats, Syndication formats, and <em>much</em>
more.</p>

<p>There are a few common threads that I felt ran through the group:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Each person has demonstrated a strong understanding of the web and
 the tools/principles that underly it.</p></li>
<li><p>Each had excellent writing skills and a passion for communicating.</p></li>
<li><p>Each had indicated publicly, at one time or another, that they were
 mildy pissed off at some aspect of the direction being taken by
 business IT and/or mass media in their attempts to bring more of
 their operations to the web.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>All in all though, there were more things the group did <em>not</em> have in
common, such as background, specific technologies, F/OSS vs. Corporate,
etc.</p>

<p>I received a truly inspiring amount of support and interest in response
but the situation is such that many of these individuals are extremely
busy and are already maintaining multiple weblogs. There&#8217;s also the
small issue of whether this makes any sense. Here we have a web pundit
known to advocate the distributed and connection-forming aspects of the
web asking others that feel the same way to discard all that and post to
one place (<em>why not just throw up a Planet?</em>). It doesn&#8217;t make a whole lot
of sense on the surface.</p>

<p>The premise is simple: for a certain large aspect of the IT community,
we&#8217;re too spread out to be heard. Many of the people we want to reach
aren&#8217;t using the tools and processes necessary (e.g. aggregators,
del.icio.us, technorati, mailing lists, etc.) to track discussion and
this makes it hard to see that we have a really large overall community
collaborating across hundreds of smaller technologies and
companies. There&#8217;s plenty of content at the lower levels but very little
oriented toward the bigger picture. The result is a perception that
there <em>isn&#8217;t</em> a bigger picture.</p>

<p>One way of overcoming this is to provide a place where individuals can
come out of their silos and speak from the position of a larger overall
organization, which is exactly what I hope to provide. So here it is:
<strong>lesscode.org is a loose federation of concerned hackers for web
preservation and advocacy.</strong> Or, at least, that&#8217;s what I hope it will
someday become :)</p>

<p>One of the problems I think we&#8217;re having is that I gave <em>no</em> guidelines
as to what topics should be covered. I did that on purpose because I
don&#8217;t want to provide a certain type of <em>content</em>, I want to provide a
certain type of <em>stage</em>. lesscode.org will be oriented toward whatever
topics its posters deem important. <a href="http://lesscode.org/2005/08/07/dont-take-your-memes-to-town/#comment-178">This comment</a>
from <a href="http://www.dehora.net/journal">Bill</a> after a post made me realize
just how poorly I&#8217;ve explained all this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ryan, You have no idea. I feel like I just burgled the place!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#8217;s your place, man! You can&#8217;t burgle it.</p>

			<p>Ah. I wondered why it&#8217;s seemed like I&#8217;ve missed the context of so many of the things I&#8217;ve read in the last few weeks. Can you hack the feed to include the &#8216;by&#8217; line, so those of us in RSS land know who&#8217;s talking and can follow the link back to read more of the author&#8217;s thoughts in their usual blog?</p>
<p>(Love the blog, though; keep it coming :-)</p>

			<p>Not sure if this might reach the right person from here.</p>
<p>There are a couple of links on the Rails wiki referring to plugins.  </p>
<p>see <a href="http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/pages/Enhanced+Form+Tag+Helper+Plugin">http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/pages/Enhanced+Form+Tag+Helper+Plugin</a></p>
<p>These links are broken, if the plugins are still under development, or available I would be interested.  And it would be good to update or remove the links from the rails wike.</p>
<p>Cheers<br />
Tony</p>

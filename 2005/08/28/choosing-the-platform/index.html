				<p>This is a two-parter in two parts.</p>

<p>A few months ago I became partial owner of a small technology company. A
long time friend and colleague had started in on a set of web applications for
managing (US) health benefits (wait - don&#8217;t go anywhere yet, this will
get on topic in a second) and succeeded in convincing me that this was
an area of business IT that could benefit excessively from being part of
the web. About 60% of this particular application&#8217;s functionality was
there when I signed on and was built using Microsoft&#8217;s .NET, SQL Server,
and IIS. My partner had little experience with the technologies I tend
to recommend on this site and so the decision was made to move forward
with the safety of .NET while researching potential alternatives for
future work.</p>

<p>My days have been spent refining and growing the .NET app while my
nights were spent researching and assembling a platform that would allow
us to work in a much more agile environment. I have a fair bit of
experience working with LAMP (where &#8220;P&#8221; is for
<a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> and &#8220;M&#8221; is for
<a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a>). That experience served as a
starting point but what I&#8217;m after is much more than a simple running
environment. I&#8217;d like to pull together the various tools necessary to
develop, test, manage, maintain, and deploy applications built on the
LAMP foundation. That means everything from Subversion to Mailman, Trac
to Wordpress, and on down into the guts of a hacking environment like
build tools (<code>make</code>, etc.), automated documentation utilities,
continuous integration and testing, etc.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s the briefest possible history to bring us up to present time
where I&#8217;d like to talk about two important observations I&#8217;ve made over
the past few months of being in this situation. I&#8217;ll be talking
primarily about Microsoft but everything here is applicable to the Java
platform and, in some cases, is more so because I&#8217;ve made a few
assumptions about what is available for .NET based on Java experience
(for instance, I&#8217;ve barely used Nant or NUnit but assume they&#8217;re roughly
on par with Ant and JUnit).</p>

<p>The first observation (and the one I will be exploring for the rest of
this post) comes from being in extremely close, and somewhat
handicapped, competition with the Microsoft platform. Please remember
that I am partial owner of this company, have a working application
written in .NET, and feel extreme amounts of pressure to create revenue
quickly while keeping cost (in both time and money) at a minimum. This
situation has forced me to use extreme prejudice when evaluating tools
and technologies. In some ways I&#8217;ve inherited the responsibility of
championing Microsoft&#8217;s platform (if only to myself) as my situation
requires that I provide real evidence that shows not only that gains can
be had by using something different but that these gains are significant
enough to justify the cost of that change. In general, the situation
just plain sucks - I have to work much harder than if we were to secure a
couple million in R&amp;D budget for the year or were juiced up on venture
cap. I&#8217;m not saying that because I wouldn&#8217;t give 100% of my capacity
in those situations but it&#8217;s hard to imagine manufacturing the level of
discipline created when your house is sunk into something.</p>

<p>Back to Microsoft&#8217;s platform: they have all the major pieces in one
place, are fairly organized, and are extremely accessible. However, time
and again I&#8217;m finding that I can beat them in almost any given area with
lightweight F/OSS technology but I can&#8217;t beat the platform as a
whole. It&#8217;s just all there. The sense of safety this creates cannot be
ignored (I&#8217;ve tried).</p>

<p>I want to be absolutely clear about that last point because I&#8217;d hate to
be misrepresented: in a great number of cases, I&#8217;ve found individual
F/OSS technologies to be superior to their Microsoft counterparts but
the lack of an overall platform whole is distressing. I don&#8217;t care about
indemnity, paid support, certification, finding people to hire, TCO
(blech!), etc. because I already understand the F/OSS answer to those
questions and they <em>are</em> compelling. I do care about being able to
answer the phone, talk to a customer, and feel confident in what and
when I can deliver. Microsoft either gives me that ability or gives me
the illusion of having that ability - it&#8217;s assuring and troubling at the
same time.</p>

<p>All this is to say that Kevin Barnes&#8217; <a href="http://www.journalhome.com/codecraft/9003/">Freedom
Languages</a> <em>really</em> hit a
chord with me. I have very little doubt in the area of language: Python
or Ruby just completely destroy any of the mainstream .NET languages and
Java to boot. What makes me feel safe is the consistency of the rest of
the tool-chain, the massive amount of component libraries, and the
breadth of the core platform.</p>

<p>I keep going back to Kevin&#8217;s idea of measuring things on the axes of
Freedom vs. Safety, where &#8220;freedom&#8221; isn&#8217;t so much
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">GNU-freedom-type-freedom</a>
but rather a sort of aggregate measure of the <a href="http://lesscode.org/2005/07/21/motherhood-and-apple-pie/">qualities we find most
compelling</a> in
software design and architecture. Weighing things on this scale helps
explain some of the intuition I&#8217;ve been feeling over the past months. If
we measure the three major platforms competing for business mind-share,
I think you find first that Microsoft is extremely safe while offering
the least freedom. Next we have Java, which is pretty safe too but the
established F/OSS communities (e.g. <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/">Apache</a>, 
<a href="http://codehaus.org/">Codehaus</a>, etc.) and even the
vendor&#8217;s (<a href="http://java.sun.com">Sun</a>, <a href="http://ibm.com">IBM</a>, <a href="http://bea.com">BEA</a>, etc.) 
positions provide a bit more freedom. We then arrive at LAMP and friends 
which tend to sacrifice safety but provide unmatched freedom and thus, when 
measured along the web&#8217;s core <a href="http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Principles.html">axioms</a>, 
quality.</p>

<p>Given those basic metrics, choosing a platform comes down to making two
key decisions: where do you fall on the safety/freedom scale <em>and</em> in
what manner would you like to proceed? Your remaining time
(e.g. forever) will be spent doing one of two things: making the
platform more safe or making the platform more free. You have infinitely
greater control over one of these situations.</p>

<p>We played the fence but I believe we&#8217;re arriving at a turning
point. I&#8217;ll talk about that in <a href="http://lesscode.org/2005/08/28/assembling-the-platform/">part two</a> because the areas explored there
are different enough to warrant a separate URL - mainly my experiences
in making the LAMP platform more safe and complete but with twists and
turns that will eat your brane.</p>

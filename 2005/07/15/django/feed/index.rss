					<description>&lt;p&gt;Tim: using an alternative template system with Django is trivial - the view methods return a string wrapped in an HttpResponse object, and it's completely up to you how you generate that string. If you don't like Django's template system, just import something else and use that to build the string that gets passed back at the end of the method.&lt;/p&gt;

					<description>&lt;p&gt;[...] One of those things that keep popping up on your internet radar: Django. A web framework that has some resemblance to Ruby on rails. The latter I haven&amp;#8217;t used jet as I was just learning Python and did not feel like starting with Ruby, but it looked very impressive and nice and clean as you&amp;#8217;d do things in Python. Now Django puts Python on rails? [...]&lt;/p&gt;

					<description>&lt;p&gt;I'm ready to try Django but I'm definitely going to see if I can shoehorn Kid in there somewhere. I've been extremely happy with kid; it looks like a better templating language than Django's system, but I haven't investigated the latter much.&lt;/p&gt;

					<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Django - Python web framework&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Django is a new web framework for the Python language created by Adrian Holovaty, Simon Willison, and Jacob Kaplan-Moss. I suspect this is going to become as popular as Ruby on Rails in no time at all. Judging from the overview, this looks pretty easy ...&lt;/p&gt;

					<description>&lt;p&gt;Thanks for the coverage. Yes, Simon was &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; involved in the creation of this framework. Simon and I created it together about two years ago, and Jacob (who posted above) took over when Simon went back to finish his degree about a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is very much a Simon Willison joint.&lt;/p&gt;

					<description>&lt;p&gt;Hey Ryan --&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm glad you're interested in Django; we're incredibly excited and proud to be releasing it.  If everything goes well, we should roll out the first public release today, but if you want to play with it before then, there are instructions on checking it out from subversion on the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, comparisons with Rails are inevitable: Django and Rails both solve the same problems.  Of course, we think Django solves them better :)&lt;/p&gt;

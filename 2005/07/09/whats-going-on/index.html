				<p>I&#8217;m glad to see that there&#8217;s been a healthy amount of interest in the
site and concept thus far. I want to talk a bit about scope because
a majority of the questions seem to be coming from that direction.</p>

<p>A comment from <a href="http://www.davidohara.net/blog/">David O&#8217;Hara</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I&#8217;ve been reading some of the links in your &#8220;About&#8221; and am quite
  curious about your ideas and philosophies on design. Hopefully, there
  will be some forthcoming posts on them. <em>hint hint</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Absolutely. Although, I think it will be more like relaying existing
ideas and philosophies that have come about organically that I&#8217;ve been
lucky enough to observe rather than anything I&#8217;ve personally sat down
and figured out myself. Great systems are grown, not designed.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t find the quote at the moment but I&#8217;d like to paraphrase <a href="http://www.shirky.com/">Clay
Shirky</a>,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I&#8217;m a hopeless anti-visionary - I find that when I concentrate too
  heavily on what <em>might</em> happen in the future, I miss what&#8217;s working
  <em>right now</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#8217;s 90% of this site&#8217;s premise. We have, at this very moment, a whole
slew of great technologies that have come about organically through years
of field experience that are being ignored and brushed aside by a large
portion of the IT community because they are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Simple</li>
<li>Not designed (in the <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/">Cathedral style</a>)</li>
</ol>

<p>In fact, you might consider lesscode.org an experiment to see how far we
can push the concepts put forth in Shirky&#8217;s <a href="http://www.shirky.com/writings/situated_software.html" title="Situated Software">Situated
Software</a> combined with the theory that great software is
evolutionary and not <q>intelligently designed</q>.</p>

<p>What happens all to often in collaborative peer development is that we
find excellent ways of doing things but since there&#8217;s rarely an &#8220;expert&#8221;
employed to evangelize and formalize these concepts or a PR department
to prepare a press release, the concepts never reach the larger
community mainstream or are perceived as being &#8220;unprofessional&#8221;. We need
to turn that thinking around.</p>

<p>Many believe we need simply to adopt the PR and evangelism techniques of
the established industry but that&#8217;s a mistake, IMO, and attempts to do
so have failed in the past. There has to be a better way, and I think
forward looking companies like <a href="http://redmonk.com/">Redmonk</a>, <a href="http://www.propylon.com/">Propylon</a>, and
<a href="http://37signals.com/">37signals</a> are blazing that trail in different areas. They are not
trying to adjust their radically different models to the established
industry, they&#8217;re forcing the established industry to adjust to <em>their</em>
model and they can because they know their model is better.</p>

<p>So I think the first step is to admit that our system of values are
really very different from those of the established industry and to stop
trying to pretend otherwise. Instead of trying to blend in, we should be
distinguishing ourselves and doing a better job of explaining why we
make the technology decisions we do. Because, I have to tell you, right
now the majority of decision makers (in corporate IT at least) believe
that J2EE (or whatever it&#8217;s called now) and .NET are the only platforms
capable of producing &#8220;real&#8221; software. But don&#8217;t blame them, that&#8217;s what
they&#8217;ve been told - we haven&#8217;t been vocal enough in rebutting the
industry story.</p>

<p>If we&#8217;re going to make a run at this, we need to accept and state
confidently that our practices are superior in many ways and then start
putting some more definition around why that&#8217;s so. We need to bring the
industry&#8217;s values in line with our in own. In many cases, this means
convincing decision makers that values like buzz, &#8220;enterprise class&#8221;,
and <em>promised</em> capability should be replaced with values like
simplicity, strong team dynamics, and <em>proven</em> capability.</p>

<p>I really need to learn how to end a post; after two years of doing this,
I&#8217;ve still not gotten the hang of it. But I&#8217;d like to leave you with
some more bits of recent philosophy that I think are interesting and
relevant:</p>

			<p>After reading thru more of your posts via what I assume to be your <a href="http://naeblis.cx/rtomayko/" title="Ryan Tomayko">personal blog</a>, I have a much better understanding of what you&#8217;re pushing for here and I have to say that I&#8217;m in agreement. I have had several conversations with co-workers and associates around some of the ideas and I understand that you&#8217;re not breaking new ground here, but since I&#8217;ve never been on it, it&#8217;s new ground to me. :) Since I&#8217;m basically a .NET guy, my knowledge of technologies such as PHP and Ruby are minimal (but I&#8217;m learning them) and I have pretty much no idea what Python is about - other than it&#8217;s a language and the files end in py. ;) I do understand though that what you&#8217;re after is a fundamental change in paradigms - utilization of what we&#8217;ve got right now in the most (more?) effective manner for the issues of right now. The tools that we have aren’t broken; they’re simply being using in a wrong or suboptimal fashion. And that, my friend, is of great interest. Keep up the great work and I look forward to future discussions.<br />
(Sorry if I get a little long winded but my &#8220;wheels&#8221; are turning&#8230;)</p>

			<p>Re: the theory that great software is evolutionary and not  &#8220;intelligently designed.&#8221; Ok so let&#8217;s take the case of Netscape Communicator. It did its job, browsing the web, but due to its rapidly executed, agile evolution, it turned into a large hairball of software. Starting over again with Mozilla then firefox was really saying. Look. We have to have some strong software architectural and design principles if we&#8217;re going to create a sustainable, extensible code base next time round. That wasn&#8217;t achieved by blind evolutionary luck, but by some intensive, careful thinking by a few folks upfront. Designing is achieving simple and elegant solutions to multi-constraint problems, by applying</p>
<ol>
<li>careful, wide-ranging associative and analogizing thought,
</li>
<li>dialectic discussions, AND
</li>
<li>experimentation.
</li>
</ol>
<p>The &#8220;code evolution&#8221; path you seem to advocate amounts to favoring only the last of these three methods of designing and realizing good code. It amounts to saying: It&#8217;s too hard to think (imagine, model) a lot up front, and it&#8217;s too hard to communicate about these models in design-language-and-pictures, so I&#8217;ll just code, then you&#8217;ll see. A judicious mix of all three methods will work better in the long run. We have big brains people, let&#8217;s use them.</p>

<p>We have big brains, but we have proven ourselves notoriously incapable of predicting emergent behaviour in complex systems correctly.</p>

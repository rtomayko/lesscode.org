					<description>&lt;p&gt;I'm not extactly sure although Hummer Winblad &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; one of two venturists putting up the cash for ActiveGrid to move forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.activegrid.com/news/pressrelease-111704.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.activegrid.com/news/pressrelease-111704.php&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess I could call them and ask...&lt;/p&gt;

					<description>&lt;p&gt;And, here's a link to the June 24, 2005 Gillmor Gang from Gnomedex 5. Pretty impressive cast, in fact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm in the midst of getting this queued up now.&lt;/p&gt;

					<description>&lt;p&gt;Okay it turns out I was completely inaccurate in almost every way. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Episode was from June 18, &lt;em&gt;2004&lt;/em&gt; and so is definitely not the &quot;latest&quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The special guest is Mitchell Kertzman&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The link was wrong.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My bad on this. Dan was talking about recording a recent Gillmor Gang at Gnomedex just a few weeks ago and when I saw the &quot;June 16&quot; in iTunes, I figured that was it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, sorry for the error. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may be interesting to dig a little and find out what company it was that they were investing in and what ended up happening to it. Anyone know off the top of their head?&lt;/p&gt;

					<description>&lt;p&gt;Hmmm. You're right. The link to IT Conversations is from February. I'm pulling the June 18 ep. from the podcast directory in iTunes. It's under &quot;ITC: Digital Rights Management&quot; for some reason. Let me see if I can dig up the link...&lt;/p&gt;

					<description>&lt;p&gt;I can't find the episode from June 18th - the latest one listed on the site is February 4th, which does feature Dan Bricklin but doesn't appear to include the content you quoted (although I haven't yet listened to the whole thing).&lt;/p&gt;

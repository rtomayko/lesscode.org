					<description>&lt;p&gt;It sounds like a basic requirement for being human but yea, I hope you'll check me if you feel I'm taking cheap shots at the establishment.&lt;/p&gt;

					<description>&lt;p&gt;It's important to keep in mind that Gandhi spoke these wise words in the context of a just and non-violent cause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I believe that the movement you're espousing is just, be aware that keeping non-violent (to include respecting your enemy as you respect yourself and your fellows) is a great test of character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It all sounds overly melodramatic, doesn't it?&lt;/p&gt;

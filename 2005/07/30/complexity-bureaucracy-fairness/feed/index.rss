					<description>&lt;p&gt;[...] I&amp;#8217;ve written previously on the trade-offs that microformats make in vocabulary design. I&amp;#8217;m still not sure how I feel about the short-string issue, but it appears no one is waiting for me to make up my mind, so I figured I&amp;#8217;d try it out. [...]&lt;/p&gt;

					<description>&lt;p&gt;Wow, I had no idea it was you Robert that had posted that article. That explains a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

					<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;s&gt;None of those are key points, because this post had nothing to do with your article or messages.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;i&gt;(Didn't mean to sound so irritated)&lt;/i&gt; It was only Tantek's comment that I disagreed with.&lt;/p&gt;

					<description>&lt;p&gt;I believe several key points are being missed in the rush to revulsion:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In [1] I clearly state that there would be a registry for microformat extensions to APP collections, thus no squatting allowed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While I have argued that some things should be put into the XHTML content, I also believe that there is some stuff that clearly belongs outside of it, for example, the pub:control [2].&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also believe that some RSS extensions should have been handled in content and not a separate namespaced element. How less functional is an enclosure element versus &quot;a href='' rel='enclosure'&quot; ?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

					<description>&lt;p&gt;That's not how xml works, is it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if you want to embed &quot;foo&quot; xml in an RSS feed? Or an XML document type that includes a &quot;friend&quot; tag? That's the problem namespaces solves and a MIME type will not help. It will only move the namespace declaration from the root element to a Content-Type header (provided it is available).&lt;/p&gt;

					<description>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Would it be OK for Microsoft to define the meaning of the word “friend?”&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would in the context of a separate media type, ala application/vnd.ms.foo+xml&lt;/p&gt;

					<description>&lt;p&gt;[...] Robert Sayre responds to Tantek Çelik:  I disagree. Namespaces can sometimes be a technical hassle, but I’ve noticed that people who rail against them are usually squatting on a set of short strings.

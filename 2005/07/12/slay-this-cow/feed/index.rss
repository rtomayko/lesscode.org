					<description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;#62; Required until proven unnecessary&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm sure the A element on the above is meant to go somewhere interesting; instead it just leads to the same page I'm looking at.&lt;/p&gt;

					<description>&lt;p&gt;DHH just posted a long rebuttal discrediting the arguments that Rails does not scale. I highly recommend reading it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also just posted a response to that discussion because I believe that they are completely missing the point. Here is what I posted:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#62; Not only do I agree with DHH that web app scalability is a non-issue with Rails, but I also think that you've been addressing the wrong scalability question. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#62; The important question is do programmers scale? Can ten programmers do ten times the work of one programmer? Most of us are aware that there is clear evidence that programmers &lt;em&gt;do not&lt;/em&gt; scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#62; From this perspective, Rails scales spectacularly better than the alternatives by boosting programmer productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

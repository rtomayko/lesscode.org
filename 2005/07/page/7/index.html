				<div class="entry">
					<p>I ride the industry analysis firms and print publications pretty hard
about the lack of playing time given to dynamic languages and simple
technologies. It is perhaps more constructive to praise the ones that
have shown an honest interest in these technologies. Here&#8217;s a partial
list:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.onlamp.com/" title="ONLamp.com">O&#8217;Reilly ONLamp</a> is the only regular publication (online or
off) that I am aware of that is dedicated to increasing awareness
of LAMP and friends.</p></li>
<li><p>O&#8217;Reilly has also published consistently great books on dynamic 
languages, Apache, Linux, BSD, etc. </p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.ddj.com/topics/">Dr. Dobb&#8217;s Journal</a> sponsors the weekly Python URL, which is 
performed by actual real members of the Python community (<a href="http://www.brunningonline.net/simon/blog/">Simon
Brunning</a> and <a href="http://phaseit.net/claird/home.html">Cameron Laird</a>). I&#8217;m not sure but I
don&#8217;t believe this makes it into their print publication.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/">IBM developerWorks</a> has published a significant number of Perl,
Python, and Ruby related material. Although, I personally dislike the
tone of most of these articles as they <a href="http://naeblis.cx/rtomayko/2005/02/18/web-dominated-by-j2ee">sometimes suggest that these
languages are just for kiddie stuff</a>. <a href="http://www.gnosis.cx/publish/">David
Mertz</a>&#8217;s <a href="http://gnosis.cx/publish/tech_index_cp.html">Charming
Python</a> column is really
very good.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I&#8217;m sure there has to be more out there. What are they?</p>

<p>Also, in case you weren&#8217;t aware, computer books and print publications
<a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/oreilly/news/ksmanifesto.html">aren&#8217;t doing very well</a>. Next time your at the bookstore or
browsing around on Amazon, consider picking up that O&#8217;Reilly Python book
you&#8217;ve been meaning to buy for a year now, or maybe one of the new <a href="http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/rails/index.html">books
on Rails</a>.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>I&#8217;m glad to see that there&#8217;s been a healthy amount of interest in the
site and concept thus far. I want to talk a bit about scope because
a majority of the questions seem to be coming from that direction.</p>

<p>A comment from <a href="http://www.davidohara.net/blog/">David O&#8217;Hara</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I&#8217;ve been reading some of the links in your &#8220;About&#8221; and am quite
  curious about your ideas and philosophies on design. Hopefully, there
  will be some forthcoming posts on them. <em>hint hint</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Absolutely. Although, I think it will be more like relaying existing
ideas and philosophies that have come about organically that I&#8217;ve been
lucky enough to observe rather than anything I&#8217;ve personally sat down
and figured out myself. Great systems are grown, not designed.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t find the quote at the moment but I&#8217;d like to paraphrase <a href="http://www.shirky.com/">Clay
Shirky</a>,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I&#8217;m a hopeless anti-visionary - I find that when I concentrate too
  heavily on what <em>might</em> happen in the future, I miss what&#8217;s working
  <em>right now</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#8217;s 90% of this site&#8217;s premise. We have, at this very moment, a whole
slew of great technologies that have come about organically through years
of field experience that are being ignored and brushed aside by a large
portion of the IT community because they are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Simple</li>
<li>Not designed (in the <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/">Cathedral style</a>)</li>
</ol>

<p>In fact, you might consider lesscode.org an experiment to see how far we
can push the concepts put forth in Shirky&#8217;s <a href="http://www.shirky.com/writings/situated_software.html" title="Situated Software">Situated
Software</a> combined with the theory that great software is
evolutionary and not <q>intelligently designed</q>.</p>

<p>What happens all to often in collaborative peer development is that we
find excellent ways of doing things but since there&#8217;s rarely an &#8220;expert&#8221;
employed to evangelize and formalize these concepts or a PR department
to prepare a press release, the concepts never reach the larger
community mainstream or are perceived as being &#8220;unprofessional&#8221;. We need
to turn that thinking around.</p>

<p>Many believe we need simply to adopt the PR and evangelism techniques of
the established industry but that&#8217;s a mistake, IMO, and attempts to do
so have failed in the past. There has to be a better way, and I think
forward looking companies like <a href="http://redmonk.com/">Redmonk</a>, <a href="http://www.propylon.com/">Propylon</a>, and
<a href="http://37signals.com/">37signals</a> are blazing that trail in different areas. They are not
trying to adjust their radically different models to the established
industry, they&#8217;re forcing the established industry to adjust to <em>their</em>
model and they can because they know their model is better.</p>

<p>So I think the first step is to admit that our system of values are
really very different from those of the established industry and to stop
trying to pretend otherwise. Instead of trying to blend in, we should be
distinguishing ourselves and doing a better job of explaining why we
make the technology decisions we do. Because, I have to tell you, right
now the majority of decision makers (in corporate IT at least) believe
that J2EE (or whatever it&#8217;s called now) and .NET are the only platforms
capable of producing &#8220;real&#8221; software. But don&#8217;t blame them, that&#8217;s what
they&#8217;ve been told - we haven&#8217;t been vocal enough in rebutting the
industry story.</p>

<p>If we&#8217;re going to make a run at this, we need to accept and state
confidently that our practices are superior in many ways and then start
putting some more definition around why that&#8217;s so. We need to bring the
industry&#8217;s values in line with our in own. In many cases, this means
convincing decision makers that values like buzz, &#8220;enterprise class&#8221;,
and <em>promised</em> capability should be replaced with values like
simplicity, strong team dynamics, and <em>proven</em> capability.</p>

<p>I really need to learn how to end a post; after two years of doing this,
I&#8217;ve still not gotten the hang of it. But I&#8217;d like to leave you with
some more bits of recent philosophy that I think are interesting and
relevant:</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>I&#8217;m pleased to announce an initial version of <a href="http://buildutils.lesscode.org/">Buildutils</a>, a set of extension commands to Python&#8217;s standard
<a href="http://www.python.org/doc/current/lib/module-distutils.html">Distutils</a>.</p>

<p>The goal of Buildutils is to distill various development procedures into
a set of simple commands under the normal Distutils idiom. All commands
are invoked and configured using standard Distutils techniques.</p>

<p>The types of commands available are similar to those that you might
throw together with <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/">make</a>. The advantage over <code>make</code> is that the
commands are written in Python and can use project metadata to provide
intelligent defaults for most commands. For example, the <a href="http://buildutils.lesscode.org/commands.html#announce">announce
command</a> can be executed as follows, without any additional
configuration beyond your normal <code>setup.py</code>:</p>

<pre><code>pbu announce
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>announce</code> command uses the metadata available for the project to
put together an announcement email and send it to a set of mailing
lists. You can tweak the way the command works by overriding defaults in
<code>setup.cfg</code> or on the command line.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d really love to see community involvement with this project. I think
we can be fairly liberal with adding new and experimental commands. For
more information, including a <a href="http://buildutils.lesscode.org/guide.html">User&#8217;s Guide</a>, <a href="http://buildutils.lesscode.org/commands.html">Command
Reference</a>, and installation info, see the <a href="http://buildutils.lesscode.org/">Buildutils Project
Page</a>.</p>

					<p>For a really long time now I&#8217;ve wanted to get my development related
projects, essays, and other ramblings into a more coherent place on the
web. At the same time, I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot about this &#8220;movement&#8221;
(for lack of a better word) that I&#8217;ve grown a small part of that is
simplifying, humanizing, and opening up IT.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a significant portion of the development community that&#8217;s just
plain pissed off at the status quo and have begun pursuing radically
different ways of building and delivering systems from what is now
commonly accepted by the established industry. To our delight, we&#8217;re
finding that <a href="http://www.zyvex.com/nanotech/feynman.html">There&#8217;s Plenty of Room at the Bottom</a> and that the
next big thing in IT should really be making it smaller.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re also finding that this new-think will not be accepted by the
mainstream analyst firms, tech publications, and vendor powerhouses on
simple merit. Pimping the latest acronym from the latest vendor with the
latest money is a much easier way of bringing in stupid amounts of cash
than is trying to move an industry forward in providing real value to
actual people. So screw you guys - your goals are in direct competition
with those of my customers.</p>

<p>As you can see, I&#8217;m a little bitter&#8230; But I&#8217;m also excited - we&#8217;re
assembling a stack of tools and techniques that are demonstrably
superior and yet somehow much simpler than those of the mainstream
past. We&#8217;re starting companies and controlling our future and it just
feels <em>right</em>.</p>

<p>So I&#8217;m proud to announce that <a href="http://lesscode.org/">lesscode.org</a> is open for
business. It&#8217;s still a work in progress but here are my goals for the
place:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Advocate, communicate, and discuss the happenings of the <q>less
movement</q>.</p></li>
<li><p>Provide tools and resources for like minded individuals to
collaborate on projects (subversion, mailman, trac, etc).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I&#8217;m also prepared to chase funding in the form of hosting, bandwidth,
admin time, etc. should their be significant interest in the concept.</p>

					<p>The site is getting there. I spent an hour or so <a href="http://lesscode.org/projects/kid/">skinning Trac</a>. I have to say, whoever did the HTML for <a href="http://trac.edgewall.com">Trac</a> did a really good job. It&#8217;s all very simple and you can tell they were anal about semantics, which makes my life a ton easier. I modified a small bit of the <code>header.cs</code> template but other than that, the redesign was done purely with CSS.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll have to announce this place over at <a href="http://naeblis.cx/rtomayko/">naeblis.cx/rtomayko/</a> but as of right now, it is imperative that I get shitfaced as soon as possible. 8)</p>

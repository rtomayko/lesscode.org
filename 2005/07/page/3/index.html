					<p>I&#8217;d like to advise everyone attending <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/os2005/" title="O'Reilly Open Source Convention 2005">OSCON</a> with an interest in dynamic languages 
to not miss <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/" title="Intertwingly - It's just data">Sam Ruby</a>&#8217;s <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2005/view/e_sess/6833" title="Pie-thon Update">pie-thon Update</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>OSCON 2004 was the home of the pie-thon challenge, which pitted Parrot
  against CPython on a test of speed using a bechmark that Guido van
  Rossum designed. This presentation provides an update&#8211;not only on
  performance, but also on language compatibility, as well as an outlook
  on the potentials for inter-language interop that can be acheived by a
  common language runtime for dynamic languages.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I was lucky enough to chat with Sam about this a bit and the little I
got out of him was intriguing. The blurb doesn&#8217;t go into a lot
of detail but one of things he&#8217;ll be talking about is compatibility
between dynamic languages at the runtime level. Here&#8217;s a sneak peek:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;rubys&gt;    There is a big difference between Python and
           Perl. Ruby might be someplace in between.
&lt;rtomayko&gt; that's interesting. I've been seeing reports of 
           the same thing from the CLR and JVM crowds
&lt;rubys&gt;    my favorite example: what does 
           """ print  '1' + '2'; """ do?
&lt;rtomayko&gt; ahh
&lt;rtomayko&gt; and so the strong/weak thing is down at that level?
&lt;rubys&gt;    it is not just that.  "+" is a function in Perl.  It 
           accepts two arguments which have types.  It coerces them 
           to numeric values, and adds them.
&lt;rtomayko&gt; python = '12', perl = 3, ruby = '12' (i think)
&lt;rubys&gt;    "+" is a synonym for "__add__" in Python.  It merely is 
           the name of a method.  What it does is up to the first 
           argument.
&lt;rtomayko&gt; right, I see. and so all of these languages will have 
           to shift a bit.
&lt;rubys&gt;    shifting all the language a bit is what .net did.  And 
           you end up with "Visual Fred" (look it up)
</code></pre>

<p><a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=visual+fred&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8" title="Visual Fred">Visual Fred</a> was the name proposed for Visual Basic.NET by MVPs
who quickly realized that VB.NET had nothing to do with VB due to the
syntactic and semantic changes forced on the language by the common
runtime.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>Once <a href="http://djangoproject.org/" title="Django">Django</a> is <em>launched-launched</em>, I&#8217;ll be comparing various
aspects of it with <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com/" title="Ruby on Rails">Ruby on Rails</a>. I plan on diving deep into
the two frameworks so instead of one large post, I&#8217;m going to make this
a running series.</p>

<p>While I&#8217;m primarily a Python coder, I&#8217;ve been dabbling with Ruby for
about a year and have a couple of apps under my belt with Rails. They
are admittedly simple apps but what isn&#8217;t with Rails? I&#8217;ve also logged
70-80 hours against a Python clone of Rails&#8217; excellent implementation of
Active Record, which put me pretty deep into the internals of that
piece.</p>

<p>I am not a Python zealot. And, to be honest, I&#8217;m floating between the
two languages as my primary. What I&#8217;m trying to say is that my interest
is in exploring these two frameworks objectively and extending my
understanding of each, not advocating one over the other. I will include
personal thoughts on design and may favor one or the other at this level
but I will not be concluding the series with a recommendation for either
because, frankly, I already know which I&#8217;d recommend at present and it
has nothing to do with technical qualities (hint: <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000484.html" title="Growing an open source ecosystem">it has everything to
do with this</a>).</p>

<p>That being said, I <em>can</em> recommend that if you are building systems that
require the complexity of a full-stack web framework (i.e. <a href="http://www.megginson.com/blogs/quoderat/archives/2005/06/11/rails-vs-php-mvc-or-view-centric/" title="Rails vs. PHP: MVC or view-centric">PHP, CGI
won&#8217;t cut it</a>) and you are currently using something other than one
of these two frameworks in any language (including Java and .NET) on any
platform, that you move swiftly to adopt either if possible. If there is
something barring you from making that switch, well, <a href="http://intertwingly.net/slides/2005/rs/7.html" title="Where's your patch?">where&#8217;s your
patch?</a> Make it happen.</p>

<p>I realize that many in the Python community have already grown
comfortable with an existing framework (or more likely, have written
their own, like myself) and that&#8217;s fine as there are some competent
frameworks out there. But it has become apparent that Django will be
growing a large community of contributors and that&#8217;s something no
current Python web framework of this kind can boast.</p>

<p>As I write this, there are 30 people idling in #django on
irc.freenode.net on a Sunday morning, two days after the none-launch;
there&#8217;s been <a href="http://del.icio.us/url/980ce09131008f964385d9fc6bf5c319">409 bookmarks on del.icio.us</a>.
Granted this is all very much driven by hype right now as there hasn&#8217;t
been any real experience with the framework, <a href="http://simon.incutio.com/archive/2005/07/17/django">excepting the
maintainers</a>, but
the outlook for a large community to finally coalesce around a single
set of tools and conventions is promising.</p>

<p>I also want to mention that I spent some time talking to the Django
maintainers last night and they&#8217;ve convinced me that the Rails
comparisons, while unavoidable, may be somewhat premature. Although
Django has many of the same traits as Rails, it wasn&#8217;t built as an all
out clone and may appeal to a slightly different set of
requirements. Time will tell, of course, but as of right now the
similarities are a huge part of what&#8217;s driving interest in Django and
there&#8217;s a good reason for that - Rails got a ton right.</p>

<p>Still, &#8220;because it&#8217;s in Rails&#8221; is unlikely to be considered sufficient
justification for Django feature requests. That&#8217;s a sure way of creating
a <em>Bride of Frankenstein</em> framework and I&#8217;m pleased to see the
maintainers have a strong sense of this. Django is likely to follow many
of the same paths as Rails but that&#8217;s because they were both designed
under real life circumstances with similarly excellent philosophy.</p>

<p>Before I wrap this up, I&#8217;d like to echo the sentiments of <a href="http://blog.yanime.org/articles/2005/07/16/ruby-has-rails-python-now-has-django">one Rails
supporter</a> 
in his comments on Django:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I hope Rails learns to play with Django and they&#8217;ll not smite each
  other (if not friends, don&#8217;t be enemies). The world is big enough. A
  combined message from different camps will be more resounding than any
  one camp trying to say he is the bestest - and coming off as naive or
  clueless.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Indeed.</p>

<p>(<em>warning:</em> stomach wrenching, <em>KUM BAI AH</em>, everyone-hold-hands type
stuff imminent)</p>

<p>The Ruby, Python, Perl, and PHP communities must understand the immense
opportunities that await them should they accept that they share much
more in common than not and that a unified front would go a long way in
tearing down the barriers that have kept these technologies out of the
mainstream. The amount of positive impact these disruptive technologies
could have on existing forms of business and social interaction in
general are limited only by our ability to tell the story.</p>

					<p>A colleague of mine had suggested on numerous occasions that I read the
book, &#8220;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0393317552/ref=pd_sxp_f/103-6627159-8051810?v=glance&amp;s=books" title="Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies">Guns, Germs, and Steel</a>&#8220;, by Jared Diamond. Wherein the
author explains that the rise of Western civilization was due largely to
a series of lucky developments that turned out to be so disruptive when
introduced into other environments that there was just no chance of their old
ways surviving.</p>

<p><a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2005/07/guns_germs_and.html" title="Guns, Germs, and Open Source">Tim O&#8217;Reilly</a> recently pointed to <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2005/view/e_sess/7121" title="Open Source and Enterprise Software: Peaceful Coexistence or All Out War">a bout</a> scheduled for
this years <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/os2005/" title="O'Reilly Open Source Convention 2005">OSCON</a> where <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2005/view/e_spkr/2231" title="Byron Sebastian - Source Labs">Byron Sebastian</a>, CEO and
Founder of <a href="http://www.sourcelabs.com/" title="SourceLabs">SourceLabs</a>, will go toe to toe with <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2005/view/e_spkr/2340" title="Bob Sutor - IBM Corporation">Bob
Sutor</a>, VP of Standards at IBM Corporation, on whether F/OSS is
to the Enterprise as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incas#Spanish_conquest_and_Vilcabamba">Guns were to the Incas</a>.</p>

<p>The format is interesting with Sebastian taking the extreme position of
&#8220;open source takes all&#8221; and Sutor the position of &#8220;protracted struggle
between proprietary and open source enterprise software&#8221;. It&#8217;s interesting
to note that they couldn&#8217;t find <em>anyone</em> to champion the &#8220;proprietary takes
all&#8221; scenario. </p>

<p>I&#8217;m not able to attend this years OSCON but I&#8217;m hoping this debate makes
it&#8217;s way onto <a href="http://itconversations.com">IT Conversations</a>. If anyone
attending wants to live blog the debate for lesscode.org, it would be
much appreciated.</p>

					<p>I&#8217;m not sure if I blacked out again and missed a couple of days there or if I&#8217;m just not paying attention but <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/">David Hansson</a>, of all people, pointed me to <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> today and I have to say I was 
impressed when I got there. Django is a web framework in Python that looks to have a lot of the same traits as Rails (is it 
okay to say that out loud?). That is, full stack, DRY, documentation, etc. &#8212; I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;re all familiar with the ingredients at 
this point.</p>

<p>Further, it seems to have the support of <a href="http://simon.incutio.com/">Simon Willison</a>, who is not only British but also an
extremely smart and pragmatic guy whose opinion I respect a great deal (so much so that I recently invited him to post here
anytime he wanted). If I remember correctly, Simon did a stint over in Lawrence, KS a few years back and whatdoyaknow, 
this framework fuels <a href="http://lawrence.com">lawrence.com</a> as well as <a href="http://chicagocrime.org">chicagocrime.org</a>, 
which is one of the more interesting twists on social/awareness software I&#8217;ve seen. I&#8217;m not sure if Simon had a hand in all
this but I do remember him speaking highly of his colleagues in Lawrence.</p>

<p>I haven&#8217;t had a chance to pull anything down and take a look just yet but it&#8217;s the first thing on my list. Also, it looks like they
haven&#8217;t quite launched yet so go easy on them.</p>

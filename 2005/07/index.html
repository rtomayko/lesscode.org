					<p><img hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right" alt="The starting line for the first Oklahoma Land Rush, April 22, 1889. (Library of Congress)" src="http://franklinmint.fm/2005/07/30/okrush89sm.gif"/></p>

<p><a href="http://bitworking.org/news/Ocean_boiling_in_the_age_of_microformats#X8">Tantek Ã‡elik</a>: <em>&#8220;The namespace problem?  The short answer is that it&#8217;s nothing more than academic chicken-littling.  The internet has worked just fine (at many levels, with many applications, specifications) without namespaces.  Namespaces try to solve a 1% problem while burdening the 99%, which is always bad economics.&#8221;</em></p>

<p>I disagree. Namespaces can sometimes be a technical hassle, but I&#8217;ve noticed that people who rail against them are usually squatting on a set of short strings. Would it be OK for Microsoft to define the meaning of the word &#8220;<a href="http://www.gmpg.org/xfn/">friend</a>?&#8221;</p>

<p><a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-tag/2005Apr/0033.html">Dan Connolly</a>: <i>&#8220;There is a time and a place for just using short strings, but since short strings are scarce resources shared by the global community, fair and open processes should be used to manage them.&#8221;</i></p>

<p>If RSS didn&#8217;t restrict extensions to namespaced elements, we would have a very ugly scene on our hands by this time. At what point does technical convenience trump social concerns? In this case, RSS favors a little technical complexity in return for less bureacracy and more fairness. Maybe <em>morecode</em> is occasionally worth it.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>If you haven&#8217;t listened to <a href="http://www.adambosworth.net/">Adam Bosworth</a>&#8217;s 
<a href="http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail571.html">Database Requirements in the Age of Scalable Services</a>,
you need to right away. The 45 minute run length seems to be limiting the
amount of listenership, which is a real shame because he makes some really 
great points in the talk.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not really about databases the way you&#8217;re thinking it is, it&#8217;s about
applying the principles that make the web work to the very generic task
of exposing, modifying, and querying data. Bosworth is thinking waaaay
out of the box here, claiming that RSS and Atom have the potential to do
for machine readable data what HTML has done for human readable
content. It seems to be an elaboration and progress report on the
thinking he demonstrated in his <a href="http://www.adambosworth.net/archives/000031.html">ISCOC04 Talk</a>,
which was <a href="http://www.technorati.com/search/www.adambosworth.net/archives/000031.html">cited heavily</a>
throughout the blogosphere.</p>

<p>But even if you don&#8217;t care about databases or Atom/RSS (let&#8217;s say you
build loan approval or payroll processing applications) you can still
get a lot from this talk by simply observing the style of thinking Adam
demonstrates. This is exactly what I&#8217;m trying to encourage with <a href="http://lesscode.org/2005/07/21/motherhood-and-apple-pie/">Motherhood
and Apple Pie</a> and
I&#8217;d like to use Adam&#8217;s talk to illustrate the different ways you can think
about the web because Bosworth&#8217;s talk is a perfect example of The
Right Way.</p>

<p>The first way of thinking about the web is to take the design you
already have, in this case relational databases, and just put it on
internet pipes (i.e. use web protocol as a conduit for what you&#8217;re
already doing). If Bosworth would have taken this approach he would have
been talking about creating an XML representation for SQL queries and
tabular data, how to hack in transaction management and isolation
levels, and other stuff like that.</p>

<p>As it were, this is not even close to what he talks about and the reason
is because that style of thinking <em>does not work</em>.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m reminded of Richard Feynman&#8217;s excellent <a href="http://www.physics.brocku.ca/etc/cargo_cult_science.html">Cargo Cult Science</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the South Seas there is a cargo cult of people. During the war they
  saw airplanes with lots of good materials, and they want the same
  thing to happen now. So they&#8217;ve arranged to make things like runways,
  to put fires along the sides of the runways, to make a wooden hut for
  a man to sit in, with two wooden pieces on his head to headphones and
  bars of bamboo sticking out like antennas&#8211;he&#8217;s the controller&#8211;and
  they wait for the airplanes to land. They&#8217;re doing everything
  right. The form is perfect. It looks exactly the way it looked
  before. But it doesn&#8217;t work. No airplanes land. So I call these things
  cargo cult science, because they follow all the apparent precepts and
  forms of scientific investigation, but they&#8217;re missing something
  essential, because the planes don&#8217;t land.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Business IT (as well as major media) are the South Seas islanders of the
web. They see the types of things the web is capable of and they try to
replicate them using their existing materials, but the planes don&#8217;t
land. You can observe this happening right now in a vast number of cases
including &#8220;Web&#8221; Services (WS-* specifically), statically typed
languages, Active X Controls, Java Applets, XForms, and <a href="http://netgazette.dmv.com/November2004.html">this
website</a> (look closely).</p>

<p>I believe the problem to be two-fold:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The great majority of experience with systems was not had with the
 constraints of the web in place. This makes conclusions drawn from
 observation of existing working systems, as well as recommendations
 based on them, extremely unreliable.</p></li>
<li><p>Very few people are aware of problem number 1 (Adam Bosworth is one
 them).</p></li>
</ol>

<p>It&#8217;s interesting that many of the individuals I can think of that
understand this situation seemed to have had to learn it the hard way 
(no offense meant to anyone in this list).
<a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/">Sam Ruby</a> participated heavily in
SOAP activity at Apache. <a href="http://www.coactus.com/blog/">Mark Baker</a>&#8217;s
username is always distobj (Distributed Object) because he was a big
CORBA head. <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/">Tim Bray</a> had a hand in XML
Namespaces and watched, if not participated in, W3C XML Schema. <a href="http://www.activegrid.com/company/management.php">Peter
Yared</a> was CTO of Sun
Microsystems&#8217; Application Server Division. I worked on XForms (among
other things). </p>

<p>Adam Bosworth actually describes this process of being slammed in the face 
with the realities of the web in his talk:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In 1995 I woke up from a sort-of Microsoft induced narcoleptic coma
  and realized there was this thing called &#8220;The Web,&#8221; and got really
  excited about it.</p>
  
  <p>How did the web happen? People take it for granted. You just assume
  that there&#8217;s always been the web. You know, in the beginning there was
  the web and the web was good and so on but that actually isn&#8217;t
  true. When Tim Berners-Lee came out with HTTP and HTML it turned out
  that he kind of hit a perfect storm of efficiency. He made something
  really simple and because it was really simple, virtually any
  P-programmer, by which I mean Perl, Python, and PHP, could generate
  web content. That was a heck of a lot easier than building on those,
  for example, really cool looking Mono apps that we just saw. Building
  a really simple form that says &#8220;here&#8217;s a list of the tasks that you
  have due today&#8221; was something that virtually anyone who could think
  could put up on the screen.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What I like to suggest to people coming from a more traditional background
in IT is that there <em>are</em> systems that evolved under the constraints of
the web and their design reflects that. Once you&#8217;ve accepted that the
previous statement is factual, you are forced to draw one of two
possible conclusions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Systems that were designed through observation of the web and/or
 in adherence to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Principles.html#PLP">core principles of the web</a> 
 must be more suitable to the web than those that were not.</p></li>
<li><p>Systems that were designed through observation of the web and/or
 in adherence to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Principles.html#PLP">core principles of the web</a> 
 must have been designed by monkeys with little understanding of
 building systems in the first place.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>It is these second types that bother me.</p>

<p>UPDATE: I forget to mention that <a href="http://cycle-gap.blogspot.com/2005/07/adam-bosworth-on-new-data-model-for.html">Rams took notes</a>  on the talk.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>I&#8217;ve been on a language and infrastructure kick for the past month or so
and posts have reflected that. Unfortunately this means I haven&#8217;t had
the time to report on some of the excellent discussion around
simplifying practices at the protocol and format level. Let&#8217;s run
through some of this real quick:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/">Sam Ruby</a> has been churning out good
content on the practical benefits of HTTP and REST architecture,
challenging SOAP/WS-* practioners to consider the immense benefits
resource oriented design offers over the more popular service oriented
(SOAP/WS-*) approaches. The Atom Wiki <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/2005/07/19/Surviving-Slashdot">was slashdotted</a>
but he was able to push the troll-hoards over to an uneditable site due
to HTTP&#8217;s redirect capabilities. He uses the occasion to illustrate one
of the many basic features HTTP provides to accomodate massively
distributed and un-coordinated environments that SOAP/WS-* completely
ignores:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The foundation for most of this is rooted in the tantalizing phrase
  &#8220;hypermedia as the engine of application state&#8221;.  If one views a wiki
  as a <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/2005/03/09/Distributed-State-Machines">state machine</a>,
  then being able to do a redirect is effectively changing the
  programming of the application.</p>
  
  <p>The fact that I was able to do all this with but a single line of code â€”
  and using only the protocols and products that were already installed â€”
  was of great value to me yesterday.  In fact, if one were predisposed to
  use such terms, I would go so far as to say it was of <strong>significant
  business value</strong> to me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sam provides more thoughts and conclussions in <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/2005/07/22/REST-vs-API">REST vs. API</a>, which
he sums up nicely:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At some point, you need to question the wisdom of having an API which
  abstracts away that which is important.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the meantime, WS-* supporters are still trying to figure out how to
fit the square peg of narrowly distributed systems architecture into the
round hole of the web. Infoworld just published <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/05/07/22/HNwsprogress_1.html">a
story</a>
that tries really hard to slap some lipstick on the WS-pig:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Although the vendors backing Web services are confident they are
  properly addressing any kinks, Web services remains hobbled by issues
  such as standardization and WSDL complexity. To make matter worse, its
  impacts are growing, with both the .Net and Java development
  technologies focusing on Web services. Additionally, Web services is
  doing double duty as the lynchpin of the growing SOA trend.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And just in case there was any doubt that many leading vendors are
completely clueless when it comes to providing tools to aid their
customer&#8217;s operations moving to the web:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Microsoftâ€™s Bixhorn emphasized the companyâ€™s planned Indigo technology
  as the answer to many issues cited with Web services. Due in 2006 in
  the Windows Longhorn client, Indigo removes the reliance on Web
  servers by extending beyond HTTP to support protocols such as SMTP,
  TCP, and REST (Representational State Transfer).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, no, no! I don&#8217;t even know where to begin disecting the problems with
this statement.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You don&#8217;t want to &#8220;remove the reliance on web servers,&#8221; you want to
provide tools that let customers use it for what it&#8217;s worth. Web
servers are good! We need to make more and better use of them.</p></li>
<li><p>Extending HTTP to &#8220;support REST&#8221; would be a truly interesting
demonstration as REST is largely a description of the architecture
HTTP facilities. <em>UPDATE: it&#8217;s been <a href="http://www.kbcafe.com/juice/?guid=20050725105910">pointed out</a>
that I may have mis-represented Krill&#8217;s intent here. I&#8217;m not sure I see a huge difference
but in the interest of rational debate and all that&#8230;</em></p></li>
<li><p><code>&lt;outrage&gt;</code>TCP?!!@%##! <strong>WHAT THE FUCK!</strong><code>&lt;/outrage&gt;</code></p></li>
</ol>

<p>I can only assume this was a horrible misprint or that Microsoft has an
automated press statement request robot capable of combining a random
set of acronyms with upcoming product names.</p>

<p>The blogosphere, at least, is injecting some sanity into the
discussion. Mark Baker wrote a nice piece, <a href="http://www.coactus.com/blog/2005/07/towards-truly-document-oriented-web-services/">Towards truly document
oriented Web services</a>,
which does a good job of explaining why the web&#8217;s basic architecture has
been and continues to be a perfect medium for &#8220;Web services&#8221; since long
before the term was even coined.</p>

<p>There were also at least two enlightening articles on Atom&#8217;s potential
as a SOAP/WS-* competitor. Bill de hÃ“ra&#8217;s <a href="http://www.dehora.net/journal/2005/07/atoms_in_a_small_world.html">Atoms in a small world</a>
is a response to a <a href="http://www.computerweekly.com/Articles/2005/07/19/210876/QuickanddirtysubstituteforSoap.htm#ContentContinues">computer weekly article</a>
making the following claim:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is clear that there are lots of server-based applications (not
  blogs) that could work by syndicating packets of XML data to client
  applications (not RSS aggregators). These will not rival Soap/web
  services as a system for executing transactions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bill responds:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I don&#8217;t see why it would not be a good basis for enterprise concerns
  like messaging, authentication, or management interfaces. Atom, RSS
  and the Atom Publishing Protocol (APP) as a complement to REST could
  disrupt SOAP and WS.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree but have a slightly different take on how this will be most
disruptive. In my opinion, REST and web architecture is just plain
misunderstood. There&#8217;s a lightbulb moment that&#8217;s required to grasp it
fully and it just hasn&#8217;t went off for a big portion of the business IT
community. RSS and Atom are showing how following web architecture can
yield huge benefits. These technologies are disruptive because it forces
people to ponder whether the web in its basic, unmolested form may not
be limited to web pages. If Atom can find a niche here than that&#8217;s great
but I&#8217;m more excited by its potential as an agent for enlightenment.</p>

<p>Kurt Cagle follows Bill&#8217;s post with some truly excellent examples of
how, in many cases, RSS/Atom can be superior to WS-* techniques in <a href="http://www.understandingxml.com/archives/2005/07/how_rssatom_is.html">How
RSS/Atom Is Replacing Web Services</a>,
which he ends with a demonstration of &#8220;good web thinking&#8221;:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While I suspect that this commentary will be poo-pooed by web services
  vendors, the history of the web makes me suspect I&#8217;ll be right in the
  end. RSS syndication has emerged in a largely ad-hoc fashion to
  fulfill a specific need - syndication - that seems to be an intrinsic
  characteristic and requirement of the Internet. Syndication in turn is
  simply a messaging protocol built around a subscription-oriented PUSH
  model. If you make the syndication format too complex for people to
  use (as I believe is the case with SOAP) then they will migrate to
  simpler formats as they become available. Because ATOM is blessed by
  both the IETF and the W3C and is seen as an open standard (whereas
  questions remain concerning the precise nature and implementation of
  SOAP) it will likely continue to gain the mindshare of developers and
  users alike.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To sum up, there&#8217;s been good stuff all around from the REST / web
architecture guys and the WS-* death march continues on&#8230;</p>

					<p>If everything works out properly, we should be seeing more of
<a href="http://www.possepdx.org/">these kinds of organizations</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Portland Open Source Software Entrepreneurs (POSSE) is a local
  organization of entrepreneurs who rely on and develop OSS to
  help businesses succeed.</p>
  
  <p>POSSE provides local businesses with access to a wealth of
  qualified options for meeting their open source software
  needs. All POSSE members are established companies that adhere
  to a defined set of industry best practices.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I touched on it a bit in <a href="http://www.possepdx.org/">Motherhood</a>
and I&#8217;ll be talking about it more - the industry is going to
start widening <em>way</em> out. We&#8217;ll see thousands of small crews
providing very targeted services. Screw infrastructure, long live
the app - you build a new one each month. We&#8217;ll build the
infrastructure collaboratively.</p>

<p>A basic level of interoperability with other crews&#8217; stuff will
come as a result of adherence to core design principles&#8230; Arrgghh, 
there&#8217;s so much to talk about here.</p>

					<description>&lt;p&gt;There's not a huge difference between &quot;extending beyond HTTP&quot; and &quot;extending HTTP&quot;? Common. Extend beyond implies using protocols other than and extend implies using protocols based on. Since SMTP is not based on HTTP, this flies directly in the face of your argument.&lt;/p&gt;

					<description>&lt;p&gt;Author said &quot;extending beyond HTTP&quot; and you translated that to &quot;extending HTTP&quot;. The REST death march continues on.&lt;/p&gt;

					<description>&lt;p&gt;SOAP is pretty easy, and it's not all .NET and Java, you can use SOAP in just about any programming languages and they all have a handful of frameworks that provide the tools necessary to make SOAP easy.  You need tools/libraries/frameworks to work with REST too, unless you're writing XML parsing by hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good thing about SOAP is that it is just a standard way to structure a request/response.  I know there are tons of other WS-stuff coming out to give web services the characteristics of things like JMS, but for most people they just want to expose a SignIn request, or a getStatus SOAP request and those are so simple, it's amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take PHP for example, you can make a SOAP call in 2 lines with PEAR::SOAP and write a SOAP server in probably less than 10 lines of code.&lt;/p&gt;

					<description>&lt;p&gt;Sounds very much like what Adam Bosworth had to say, I quickly scribbled down the main points from his talk (now available at itconversations.com) here:&lt;/p&gt;

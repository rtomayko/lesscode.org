					<description>&lt;p&gt;I agree with Alex B. – SOA is the biggest and baddest buzzword to hit our IT industry to date. See: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hurwitz.com/newsletters/soa---towards-the-industrialization-of-software-5.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;SOA – Towards The Industrialization Of Software&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With respect to legacy systems, being first class citizens exposing data; to quote &lt;a href=&quot;http://pluralsight.com/blogs/dbox/archive/2005/09/22/14989.aspx&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Don Box&lt;/a&gt;, “Message, oh message, the truth is on the wire.  There is nothing else.”  And that is the point of SOA.  Who cares if it came from a legacy RDBMS or anything else for that matter, the truth is still on the wire.  And everyone wants to know the truth, right? :-)&lt;/p&gt;

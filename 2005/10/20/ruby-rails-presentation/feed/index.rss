					<description>&lt;p&gt;Ryan Tomayko:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;These slides are very good, Alex. You should try to get audio next time.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks Ryan. Goes without saying that a lot of my philosophy expressed in there was partially inspired by your seminal &lt;a href=&quot;http://lesscode.org/2005/07/21/motherhood-and-apple-pie/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Motherhood and Apple Pie&lt;/a&gt; essay. So my hat goes off to you for formulating and articulating such a cogent set of views!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will try and get the audio/video, even if I have to pry it out of the organizers' hands. The actual meat of the presentation is not included in my slides, because after the introductory presentation, I demoed my development philosophy using my product ScenicRoute which plugs into Ruby on Rails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully more about that soon...&lt;/p&gt;

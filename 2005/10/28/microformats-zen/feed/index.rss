					<description>&lt;p&gt;Grumpy, you don't need god for that; that's what microformats are for. They need to have a reason, they have an audience (anyone with a browser), and we're building toolchains.
Well over a million blogs use rel=&quot;tag&quot;;  every Avon lady has an hCard.&lt;/p&gt;

					<description>&lt;p&gt;oh god save us from the bored web2 gurus who dream up ad-hoc transmission standards one after the other with no useful audience, no toolchain, no REASON.  take a look around the web at who is placing these formats on webpages. anyone? bueller, bueller, bueller...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;do even the microformats gurus publish microformats? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;this is web2 doing what is does best - answering questions no one is asking.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;That we don’t know anything until we’ve observed it. Respect for this simple truth leads to dramatic changes in how one builds and evaluates technology and you can see this happening to great effect (and with equally great results) in each of these communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I agree with this principle in all innovative, novel endeavores. I also particularlly agree with the &lt;strong&gt;leave the 20% out&lt;/strong&gt;, if I can phrase it that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just wanted to point out that occationally we don't need to &quot;wait until we've observed it&quot;, when there can be proper and addequate market research done before the implementation phase. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, where possible, do the research and hit the 80% of the proposed features which really meet the market well. And where not possible, get something out there and &quot;see what happens&quot; when there is no good research to be done. Programmers, I believe, too often don't understand or think the same way as the eventual end user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do hope that microformats gains more and more momentum.&lt;/p&gt;

					<description>&lt;p&gt;hxa: May &lt;em&gt;evolution&lt;/em&gt; isn't a perfectly accurate term but the point is that the community is interested in an iterative, feedback dominated standardization process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tantek: sure will.&lt;/p&gt;

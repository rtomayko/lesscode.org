<a href="http://christopherwine.com/">Chris Wine</a> left this as a comment
and I thought it deserved a page of its own. &#8212; Ryan
</small></p>

<p>In a recent meeting with a BEA developer, I was told how a small non
profit recently converted their website from ASP to PHP.  Why I
immediately asked?  Because the resources for the implementation were
less expensive, and there were thousands of CMS, blog and wiki
applications to choose from, rather than just a few in the Microsoft
environment.  Application availability used to be the Achilles heel of
platforms that competed with Microsoft.  I remember UNIX vendors not
having “enough” applications running on their OS, and paying big bucks
to ISVs to port product to their platform.  Now these scripting
languages with zero marketing budgets have flipped the tables on
Microsoft.  I am impressed.</p>

<p>Scripting languages are winning the mind share for developers, because
recent grads know and like these languages.  They are easy and
inexpensive to deploy, and you get results fast.  While some say they
are not scaleable, developments at Google and Yahoo say otherwise.  For
those that still want a more proven solution for large deployments, Java
has its place in companies that have requirements for thousands of
concurrent users.  That said, there are many more companies that do not
have requirements for thousands of concurrent users.  And as Joel
Spolsky says, &#8220;It is easier to start small and cheap and scale up, than
to start big and expensive and scale down.&#8221;</p>

<p>I ran some quick searches, to determine what people in the technology
universe are talking about.  While my survey is by no means a scientific
random sample, I still believe it has some merit.  Also, I used less
than ideal search parameters for the scripting languages as some of them
are common words (Python and Ruby).The merit is not in the absolute
values, but in the ratios.  I believe that the number of relevant posts
on these scripting languages is 300-1000% higher than what I show
below.</p>

<h3>Conclusions</h3>

<p>The revolution is here. It may not be televised (yet!) but it is being
blogged, and otherwise documented.  BEA may of may not get bought.  I
don’t know, and now that I am wrapping up this post, I think my original
uninteresting.  The more interesting question is &#8220;Will the scripting
languages assume the role of Linux in the mid-nineties?&#8221; Can scripting
languages be a mindshare leader in 10 years, with growth outpacing all
of the J2EE vendors and .NET combined? In 2015, will we talk primarily
about .NET, and some scripting language(s)?</p>

<p>Does anyone even doubt this hyposthesis?</p>

<p>End of rant.</p>

					<p>I&#8217;d like to advise everyone attending <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/os2005/" title="O'Reilly Open Source Convention 2005">OSCON</a> with an interest in dynamic languages 
to not miss <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/" title="Intertwingly - It's just data">Sam Ruby</a>&#8217;s <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2005/view/e_sess/6833" title="Pie-thon Update">pie-thon Update</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>OSCON 2004 was the home of the pie-thon challenge, which pitted Parrot
  against CPython on a test of speed using a bechmark that Guido van
  Rossum designed. This presentation provides an update&#8211;not only on
  performance, but also on language compatibility, as well as an outlook
  on the potentials for inter-language interop that can be acheived by a
  common language runtime for dynamic languages.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I was lucky enough to chat with Sam about this a bit and the little I
got out of him was intriguing. The blurb doesn&#8217;t go into a lot
of detail but one of things he&#8217;ll be talking about is compatibility
between dynamic languages at the runtime level. Here&#8217;s a sneak peek:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;rubys&gt;    There is a big difference between Python and
           Perl. Ruby might be someplace in between.
&lt;rtomayko&gt; that's interesting. I've been seeing reports of 
           the same thing from the CLR and JVM crowds
&lt;rubys&gt;    my favorite example: what does 
           """ print  '1' + '2'; """ do?
&lt;rtomayko&gt; ahh
&lt;rtomayko&gt; and so the strong/weak thing is down at that level?
&lt;rubys&gt;    it is not just that.  "+" is a function in Perl.  It 
           accepts two arguments which have types.  It coerces them 
           to numeric values, and adds them.
&lt;rtomayko&gt; python = '12', perl = 3, ruby = '12' (i think)
&lt;rubys&gt;    "+" is a synonym for "__add__" in Python.  It merely is 
           the name of a method.  What it does is up to the first 
           argument.
&lt;rtomayko&gt; right, I see. and so all of these languages will have 
           to shift a bit.
&lt;rubys&gt;    shifting all the language a bit is what .net did.  And 
           you end up with "Visual Fred" (look it up)
</code></pre>

<p><a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=visual+fred&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8" title="Visual Fred">Visual Fred</a> was the name proposed for Visual Basic.NET by MVPs
who quickly realized that VB.NET had nothing to do with VB due to the
syntactic and semantic changes forced on the language by the common
runtime.</p>

coming out of Microsoft Corporation. The paper is titled, 
<cite>Static Typing Where Possible, Dynamic Typing When Needed:
The End of the Cold War Between Programming Languages</cite>. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We are interesting in building data-intensive three-tiered enterprise
  applications. Perhaps surprisingly, dynamism is probably more
  important for data intensive programming than for any other area where
  people traditionally position dynamic languages and scripting.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#8217;s the first part of one of many paragraphs I found intriguing and,
IMO, is dead on. Unfortunately, that leads us to the sentences that are
meant to support that claim:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Currently, the vast majority of digital data is not fully
  structured, a common rule of thumb is less then 5 percent. In many
  cases, the structure of data is only statically known up to some
  point, for example, a comma separated file, a spreadsheet, an XML
  document, but lacks a schema that completely describes the instances
  that a program is working on. Even when the structure of data is
  statically known, people often generate queries dynamically based on
  runtime information, and thus the structure of the query results is
  statically unknown.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;m not sure I follow the logic here. Dynamic languages like Python,
Ruby, and Perl have a more powerful set of data manipulation facilities
that require less code and read easier than their statically typed
analogs in Java, C#, and C++ but they&#8217;re no more aware of the data&#8217;s
underlying type system. I have a bad feeling they really wanted to go
down the same old SOAP/RPC and XML Schema (see: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=40&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;c2coff=1&amp;q=gHorribleKludge&amp;btnG=Search">gHorribleKludge</a>) data
binding path here and figure out how we can just abstract away the
entire concept of data and make everything look like nice little
objects. If it didn&#8217;t work with our current languages, it must be a
problem with the language, right?</p>

<p>Anyway, the paper received a pretty thorough beat-down over at
<a href="http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/view/834" title="Discussion at Lambda">Lambda</a>, which is always a bad sign when you&#8217;re talking at the
type/language theory level. I personally have mixed feelings on the
paper - while I think anything that puts dynamic languages on equal
ground with the more accepted statically typed languages is a good
thing, I&#8217;m not sure that inventing a new <q>peacefully integrated</q>
language and discarding the ones we&#8217;ve actually observed working for so
long is the best way forward.</p>

<p>How about you guys just drop your types for now and we&#8217;ll add them back
in later. :)</p>

Neither have actually progressed so far as to make actual comparisons but if they end up being anything like the <a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/pywebblog/">PyWebOff</a> blog, which compares Python web frameworks, they&#8217;ll be a tremendous resource for the community. </p>

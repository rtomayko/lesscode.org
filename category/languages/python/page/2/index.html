					<p><a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2005/08/codezoo_program_1.html">This chart</a> showing the number of requests for different languages on <a href="http://www.codezoo.com/">O&#8217;Reilly&#8217;s Code Zoo</a> is interesting:</p>

<p><a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2005/08/codezoo_program_1.html"><img src="http://photos23.flickr.com/31279884_afc829dd3b_t.jpg" width="100" height="94" alt="CodeZoo language breakdown" style="float: right"/></a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Yesterday we added two new languages to CodeZoo: Python and Ruby. You can see from the language requests graph, above, the languages for which we got more than a few requests (I&#8217;ve left off Cobol and the others that only were requested a couple of times). From this, the choice of Python is completely obvious &#8212; it was the winner in the request race, beating out C++ and many other languages that might be considered &#8220;larger&#8221; by other metrics. In addition to the clear demand for it, Python is a natural fit for O&#8217;Reilly, since we publish a great deal of treeware and online material about Python, and cover Python extensively at our conferences (especially at the Open Source Convention taking place this week).</p>
  
  <p>Ruby, however, is tied for fifth on the list, and in raw component counts on our site, it is the smallest of the languages we support. As we&#8217;ve discussed on Radar over the past few months, we see Ruby as an emerging force in the open source world, driven by interest in Ruby on Rails, and by the excellent books on Ruby written by the Pragmatic Programmers&#8230;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I was actually really surprised at how strongly dynamic languages showed up on this chart. I&#8217;m eye-balling it as there aren&#8217;t any numbers but Python, PHP, Ruby, and Perl seem to have taken down almost 50% of the requests with C{,#,++} taking down a large majority of the rest. Is this a fair sampling of the general development population? Developers with a web/UNIXy background seem to be over-represented at O&#8217;Reilly so its probably a bit skewed, no? Still, the amount of acceptance dynamic languages are gaining is pretty staggering at this point.</p>

					<p>I&#8217;d like to advise everyone attending <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/os2005/" title="O'Reilly Open Source Convention 2005">OSCON</a> with an interest in dynamic languages 
to not miss <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/" title="Intertwingly - It's just data">Sam Ruby</a>&#8217;s <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2005/view/e_sess/6833" title="Pie-thon Update">pie-thon Update</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>OSCON 2004 was the home of the pie-thon challenge, which pitted Parrot
  against CPython on a test of speed using a bechmark that Guido van
  Rossum designed. This presentation provides an update&#8211;not only on
  performance, but also on language compatibility, as well as an outlook
  on the potentials for inter-language interop that can be acheived by a
  common language runtime for dynamic languages.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I was lucky enough to chat with Sam about this a bit and the little I
got out of him was intriguing. The blurb doesn&#8217;t go into a lot
of detail but one of things he&#8217;ll be talking about is compatibility
between dynamic languages at the runtime level. Here&#8217;s a sneak peek:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;rubys&gt;    There is a big difference between Python and
           Perl. Ruby might be someplace in between.
&lt;rtomayko&gt; that's interesting. I've been seeing reports of 
           the same thing from the CLR and JVM crowds
&lt;rubys&gt;    my favorite example: what does 
           """ print  '1' + '2'; """ do?
&lt;rtomayko&gt; ahh
&lt;rtomayko&gt; and so the strong/weak thing is down at that level?
&lt;rubys&gt;    it is not just that.  "+" is a function in Perl.  It 
           accepts two arguments which have types.  It coerces them 
           to numeric values, and adds them.
&lt;rtomayko&gt; python = '12', perl = 3, ruby = '12' (i think)
&lt;rubys&gt;    "+" is a synonym for "__add__" in Python.  It merely is 
           the name of a method.  What it does is up to the first 
           argument.
&lt;rtomayko&gt; right, I see. and so all of these languages will have 
           to shift a bit.
&lt;rubys&gt;    shifting all the language a bit is what .net did.  And 
           you end up with "Visual Fred" (look it up)
</code></pre>

<p><a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=visual+fred&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8" title="Visual Fred">Visual Fred</a> was the name proposed for Visual Basic.NET by MVPs
who quickly realized that VB.NET had nothing to do with VB due to the
syntactic and semantic changes forced on the language by the common
runtime.</p>

					<p>I just stumbled on, not one, but <em>two</em> separate weblogs dedicated to comparing and contrasting various Python template languages.

				<div class="entry">
					<p>Ruby-styled blocks in Python have been something to be a bit anxious
about. After spending even a little time working with Ruby, it&#8217;s really
hard to get the idioms that blocks facilitate out of your head. Dealing
with certain types of problems with coroutines just <em>feels</em> right:</p>

<pre><code>File.open("bla.txt") do |file|
   file.read()
end
</code></pre>

<p>With the equivalent Python being roughly:</p>

<pre><code>file = open('foo.txt')
try:
    file.read()
finally:
    file.close()
</code></pre>

<p>Eewww. What attracted me to Python was its ability to make code read
very closely to its intent as it would be described by a human. Resource
aquisition/release is one of those things that I&#8217;d rather not have to
read about when I&#8217;m trying to extract the essence of what a piece of
code is doing.</p>

<p>Of course, you can get close in most cases by using normal callable
passing&#8230;</p>

<pre><code>def with_open_file(file, block):
    try:
        block(file)
    finally:
        file.close()

def do_stuff(file):
    file.read()

with_open_file(open('bla.txt'), do_stuff)
</code></pre>

<p>&#8230; but the Ruby block syntax reads better to these eyes and it seems
I&#8217;m not the only one. A few weeks ago, Guido <a href="http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2005-June/054269.html">had this to say</a>
about the block style in relation to recent PEP activity:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>That was all before I (re-)discovered yield-expressions (in Ruby!),
  and mostly in response to the most recent version of PEP 288, with its
  problem of accessing the generator instance. I now strongly feel that
  g.next(EXPR) and yield-expressions are the way to go.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I&#8217;ve been following the succession of PEPs that have led us to
<a href="http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0342.html" title="Coroutines via Enhanced Generators">PEP-342</a>, <cite>Coroutines via Enhanced Generators</cite>, and
<a href="http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0343.html" title="Anonymous Block Redux and Generator Enahncements">PEP-343</a>, <cite>Anonymous Block Redux and Generator
Enahncements</cite>, with great interest.</p>

<p>It looks like there&#8217;s a decent chance that we&#8217;ll be able to stuff like
this in Python 2.5:</p>

<pre><code> @with_template
 def opening(filename, mode="r"):
     file = open(filename, mode)
     try:
         yield file
     finally:
         file.close()

 with opening("/etc/passwd") as file:
     file.read()
</code></pre>

<p>This is accomplished not by adding an implicitly passed block construct
like Ruby&#8217;s <code>&amp;block</code>, but by adding a basic message passing protocol for
generators. Generators will have two new methods: <code>send</code> and
<code>throw</code>. The important one here is <code>throw</code>, which tells the generator to
raise an <code>Exception</code> at its suspension point. All of this is hidden
behind the implementation of <code>with_template</code> (sample implementation in
<a href="http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0342.html" title="Coroutines via Enhanced Generators">PEP-342</a>).</p>

<p>What I&#8217;m interested in understanding more fully is how the PEP proposed
enhancements to generators will work in iterative cases or whether
that&#8217;s planned at all. The examples seem targeted toward resource
aquisition/release (which is fine, there&#8217;s definitely a strong set of
use cases in that area). But I&#8217;m interested in understanding how cases
similar to Ruby&#8217;s <code>IO.foreach</code> will be handled:</p>

<pre><code>IO.foreach("testfile") { |line| puts line }
</code></pre>

<p>Note that this is different from Python&#8217;s&#8230;</p>

<pre><code>for line in open('testfile').readlines():
    print line
</code></pre>

<p>&#8230; for a few reasons. First, resource aquisition/release is handled
within <code>IO.foreach</code> where in the preceding Python snippet, it isn&#8217;t
really handled at all. Second, <code>IO.foreach</code> reads the file iteratively,
calling the block each time, where as an approach using Python
generators, such as follows&#8230;</p>

<pre><code>def lines(filename):
    f = open(filename)
    try:
        line = f.readline()
        while line:
           yield line
           line = f.readline()
    finally:
        f.close()

for line in lines('foo.txt'):
    raise Exception("this doesn't work")
</code></pre>

<p>&#8230; falls apart because the exception raised in the iterating block is
not automatically signaled back to the generator. There&#8217;s no guarantee
that the finally block will execute when the iterating block exits.</p>

<p>I have a feeling there&#8217;s some aspect of this that I&#8217;m not fully
grasping. Perhaps Phillip (<a href="http://dirtsimple.org/">PING</a>) or someone else with a good understanding of
the proposed generator enhancements can stop by and comment; inquiring
minds want to know&#8230;</p>

					<p>I&#8217;m pleased to announce an initial version of <a href="http://buildutils.lesscode.org/">Buildutils</a>, a set of extension commands to Python&#8217;s standard
<a href="http://www.python.org/doc/current/lib/module-distutils.html">Distutils</a>.</p>

<p>The goal of Buildutils is to distill various development procedures into
a set of simple commands under the normal Distutils idiom. All commands
are invoked and configured using standard Distutils techniques.</p>

<p>The types of commands available are similar to those that you might
throw together with <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/">make</a>. The advantage over <code>make</code> is that the
commands are written in Python and can use project metadata to provide
intelligent defaults for most commands. For example, the <a href="http://buildutils.lesscode.org/commands.html#announce">announce
command</a> can be executed as follows, without any additional
configuration beyond your normal <code>setup.py</code>:</p>

<pre><code>pbu announce
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>announce</code> command uses the metadata available for the project to
put together an announcement email and send it to a set of mailing
lists. You can tweak the way the command works by overriding defaults in
<code>setup.cfg</code> or on the command line.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d really love to see community involvement with this project. I think
we can be fairly liberal with adding new and experimental commands. For
more information, including a <a href="http://buildutils.lesscode.org/guide.html">User&#8217;s Guide</a>, <a href="http://buildutils.lesscode.org/commands.html">Command
Reference</a>, and installation info, see the <a href="http://buildutils.lesscode.org/">Buildutils Project

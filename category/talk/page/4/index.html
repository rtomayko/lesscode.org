					<p>What are you guys thinking about <a href="http://www.fundable.org/">Fundable.org</a>?
Newsforge has the <a href="http://business.newsforge.com/print.pl?sid=05/07/07/1330241">short and sweet</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The concept, while unique, is quite simple. Anyone who has a product
  or service to sell, or needs monetary support for a charitable cause,
  or who wants to organize a group purchase, posts their requirement on
  Fundable.org. They specify the number of contributors needed and the
  amount of money required from each. They also specify a deadline by
  which to raise the needed capital. Fundable.org holds all
  contributions until the total amount requested is received, or the
  deadline is reached. If, by the deadline, the amount contributed is
  less than the required amount, the project is scrapped and the
  contributors receive a full refund.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;ve yet to see a working method of raising money on the web for
collaborative development and I&#8217;m skeptical by default besides. That
being said, this <em>does</em> have some interesting ideas attached to it that
I&#8217;ve not seen elsewhere and sometimes a slight modification makes all the
difference.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m sorry to say that I don&#8217;t think this is going to be a revolution in
funding projects based on anonymous donation but here&#8217;s a few scenarios
where Fundable may be useful in collaborative development:</p>

<h4>User Groups</h4>

<p>I&#8217;m a member of a few local area user groups and there&#8217;s a frequent need
to raise money: food, venues, food, fix things that are broken at
people&#8217;s houses, and food.</p>

<p>Of course, telling everyone to bring $5 to the next meeting works pretty
well, too.</p>

<h4>Infrastructure</h4>

<p>Hardware and bandwidth can be had for cheap if you can find a nice
little group of people with OS and configuration tastes similar to your
own. I&#8217;d rather split up a root level, dedicated, co-located box between
5 others than deal with a shared or virtual box.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s something to try: go out and find a nice hosting plan, determine
the optimal number of people needed to get the cost down but not tax the
box, throw something up on fundable and then point people to it via
weblog. I&#8217;d think you may have a decent chance of working something out.</p>

<p>Oh well, it will be interesting to see the types of uses people put
Fundable to in the next few months.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>For a really long time now I&#8217;ve wanted to get my development related
projects, essays, and other ramblings into a more coherent place on the
web. At the same time, I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot about this &#8220;movement&#8221;
(for lack of a better word) that I&#8217;ve grown a small part of that is
simplifying, humanizing, and opening up IT.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a significant portion of the development community that&#8217;s just
plain pissed off at the status quo and have begun pursuing radically
different ways of building and delivering systems from what is now
commonly accepted by the established industry. To our delight, we&#8217;re
finding that <a href="http://www.zyvex.com/nanotech/feynman.html">There&#8217;s Plenty of Room at the Bottom</a> and that the
next big thing in IT should really be making it smaller.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re also finding that this new-think will not be accepted by the
mainstream analyst firms, tech publications, and vendor powerhouses on
simple merit. Pimping the latest acronym from the latest vendor with the
latest money is a much easier way of bringing in stupid amounts of cash
than is trying to move an industry forward in providing real value to
actual people. So screw you guys - your goals are in direct competition
with those of my customers.</p>

<p>As you can see, I&#8217;m a little bitter&#8230; But I&#8217;m also excited - we&#8217;re
assembling a stack of tools and techniques that are demonstrably
superior and yet somehow much simpler than those of the mainstream
past. We&#8217;re starting companies and controlling our future and it just
feels <em>right</em>.</p>

<p>So I&#8217;m proud to announce that <a href="http://lesscode.org/">lesscode.org</a> is open for
business. It&#8217;s still a work in progress but here are my goals for the
place:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Advocate, communicate, and discuss the happenings of the <q>less
movement</q>.</p></li>
<li><p>Provide tools and resources for like minded individuals to
collaborate on projects (subversion, mailman, trac, etc).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I&#8217;m also prepared to chase funding in the form of hosting, bandwidth,
admin time, etc. should their be significant interest in the concept.</p>

					<p>The site is getting there. I spent an hour or so <a href="http://lesscode.org/projects/kid/">skinning Trac</a>. I have to say, whoever did the HTML for <a href="http://trac.edgewall.com">Trac</a> did a really good job. It&#8217;s all very simple and you can tell they were anal about semantics, which makes my life a ton easier. I modified a small bit of the <code>header.cs</code> template but other than that, the redesign was done purely with CSS.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll have to announce this place over at <a href="http://naeblis.cx/rtomayko/">naeblis.cx/rtomayko/</a> but as of right now, it is imperative that I get shitfaced as soon as possible. 8)</p>

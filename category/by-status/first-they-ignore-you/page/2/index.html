				<div class="entry">
					<p>If I were to state that software industry is in crisis, I would be guilty of stating the obvious. The field of software development has been in crisis ever since the early ‘90s, if not even earlier than that.</p>

<p>But what’s important is to realize that nowadays, this crisis has reached major proportions. I know I sound like yet another ‘the sky is falling’ FUD protagonist, but there simply isn’t any other way to look at the problem. A significant number of mid sized and large corporations worldwide have been ‘once bitten, twice shy’ when it comes to making any significant investment in their software practices. Thus, the status quo situation is growing stale at a breakneck pace.</p>

<p>So why am I bringing this up? Simply because I am sensing an impeding tension building up between the proposed practices of software industrialization as opposed to staying with the tried-and-true practices of crafting software by hand.</p>

<p>Software industrialization (you can read more about it <a href=http://www.softwarefactories.com/>here</a>) proponents insist that, in order to get out of the software development slump, we must make a transition from the hand crafted way of developing software to a full blown industrial assembly line model.</p>

<p>Fine. Automate as much as possible, rendering the whole process much more affordable. What could be wrong with that?</p>

<p>But not so fast. At the same time, while we’re getting caught in endless deliberation over whether Microsoft or Java or Oracle or SAP or LAMP or…? should be the worldwide software ‘industrializator’, another light at the end of the tunnel is becoming more and more visible. This light is what I would call the ‘smart servant’ approach.</p>

<p>So, instead of the proposed ‘dumb workforce’ mass industrialization model, an alternative model is being proposed whereby a handful of smart servants should be deployed to accomplish the workload of huge army of faceless, nameless drones.</p>

<p>In other words, instead of generating faceless, nameless reams of cheap software code, the alternative approach offers the possibility of hand crafting very high quality software code that will bring additional power to its users.</p>

<p>The ‘smart servant’ principle claims that it is better to employ a smart person or device, who will be able to accomplish complex tasks upon hearing just a handful of simple commands, than to employ an army of dumb devices who will have to be fed large lists of aggregated complex instructions, to be followed blindly.</p>

<p>The question, of course, is why should a smart servant be a better model?</p>

<p>Before I offer  my views on why this should be so, I’d like to pause for a minute, and see if anyone would like to tackle this little challenge?</p>

<p>And so, without further ado, I’d like to now open the floor for a brief discussion on this topic…</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>You may have noticed posts by a few really really smart individuals here
over the past weeks. I feel like I should explain what&#8217;s going on and
attempt a basic description of what I hope lesscode.org might
become. Keep in mind that this is all very much a pipe-dream at this
point.</p>

<p>About a month ago I sent an invitation to a handful of people that I
feel have an excellent grasp on the history and potential of the web and
IT in general and invited them to post here (I don&#8217;t feel comfortable
listing names because I don&#8217;t want to get everyone&#8217;s hopes up). The
list was small but the group covered an insane amount of expertise in
technologies like PHP, Python, Perl, Ruby, Rails, Apache, HTTP, Web
Architecture, XML, AJAX, Microformats, Syndication formats, and <em>much</em>
more.</p>

<p>There are a few common threads that I felt ran through the group:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Each person has demonstrated a strong understanding of the web and
 the tools/principles that underly it.</p></li>
<li><p>Each had excellent writing skills and a passion for communicating.</p></li>
<li><p>Each had indicated publicly, at one time or another, that they were
 mildy pissed off at some aspect of the direction being taken by
 business IT and/or mass media in their attempts to bring more of
 their operations to the web.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>All in all though, there were more things the group did <em>not</em> have in
common, such as background, specific technologies, F/OSS vs. Corporate,
etc.</p>

<p>I received a truly inspiring amount of support and interest in response
but the situation is such that many of these individuals are extremely
busy and are already maintaining multiple weblogs. There&#8217;s also the
small issue of whether this makes any sense. Here we have a web pundit
known to advocate the distributed and connection-forming aspects of the
web asking others that feel the same way to discard all that and post to
one place (<em>why not just throw up a Planet?</em>). It doesn&#8217;t make a whole lot
of sense on the surface.</p>

<p>The premise is simple: for a certain large aspect of the IT community,
we&#8217;re too spread out to be heard. Many of the people we want to reach
aren&#8217;t using the tools and processes necessary (e.g. aggregators,
del.icio.us, technorati, mailing lists, etc.) to track discussion and
this makes it hard to see that we have a really large overall community
collaborating across hundreds of smaller technologies and
companies. There&#8217;s plenty of content at the lower levels but very little
oriented toward the bigger picture. The result is a perception that
there <em>isn&#8217;t</em> a bigger picture.</p>

<p>One way of overcoming this is to provide a place where individuals can
come out of their silos and speak from the position of a larger overall
organization, which is exactly what I hope to provide. So here it is:
<strong>lesscode.org is a loose federation of concerned hackers for web
preservation and advocacy.</strong> Or, at least, that&#8217;s what I hope it will
someday become :)</p>

<p>One of the problems I think we&#8217;re having is that I gave <em>no</em> guidelines
as to what topics should be covered. I did that on purpose because I
don&#8217;t want to provide a certain type of <em>content</em>, I want to provide a
certain type of <em>stage</em>. lesscode.org will be oriented toward whatever
topics its posters deem important. <a href="http://lesscode.org/2005/08/07/dont-take-your-memes-to-town/#comment-178">This comment</a>
from <a href="http://www.dehora.net/journal">Bill</a> after a post made me realize
just how poorly I&#8217;ve explained all this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ryan, You have no idea. I feel like I just burgled the place!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#8217;s your place, man! You can&#8217;t burgle it.</p>

<p><a href="http://bitworking.org/news/Ocean_boiling_in_the_age_of_microformats#X8">Tantek Çelik</a>: <em>&#8220;The namespace problem?  The short answer is that it&#8217;s nothing more than academic chicken-littling.  The internet has worked just fine (at many levels, with many applications, specifications) without namespaces.  Namespaces try to solve a 1% problem while burdening the 99%, which is always bad economics.&#8221;</em></p>

<p>I disagree. Namespaces can sometimes be a technical hassle, but I&#8217;ve noticed that people who rail against them are usually squatting on a set of short strings. Would it be OK for Microsoft to define the meaning of the word &#8220;<a href="http://www.gmpg.org/xfn/">friend</a>?&#8221;</p>

<p><a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-tag/2005Apr/0033.html">Dan Connolly</a>: <i>&#8220;There is a time and a place for just using short strings, but since short strings are scarce resources shared by the global community, fair and open processes should be used to manage them.&#8221;</i></p>

<p>If RSS didn&#8217;t restrict extensions to namespaced elements, we would have a very ugly scene on our hands by this time. At what point does technical convenience trump social concerns? In this case, RSS favors a little technical complexity in return for less bureacracy and more fairness. Maybe <em>morecode</em> is occasionally worth it.</p>

					<p>If everything works out properly, we should be seeing more of
<a href="http://www.possepdx.org/">these kinds of organizations</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Portland Open Source Software Entrepreneurs (POSSE) is a local
  organization of entrepreneurs who rely on and develop OSS to
  help businesses succeed.</p>
  
  <p>POSSE provides local businesses with access to a wealth of
  qualified options for meeting their open source software
  needs. All POSSE members are established companies that adhere
  to a defined set of industry best practices.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I touched on it a bit in <a href="http://www.possepdx.org/">Motherhood</a>
and I&#8217;ll be talking about it more - the industry is going to
start widening <em>way</em> out. We&#8217;ll see thousands of small crews
providing very targeted services. Screw infrastructure, long live
the app - you build a new one each month. We&#8217;ll build the
infrastructure collaboratively.</p>

<p>A basic level of interoperability with other crews&#8217; stuff will
come as a result of adherence to core design principles&#8230; Arrgghh, 
there&#8217;s so much to talk about here.</p>

					<p><a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000486.html" title="Anyone using the dynamic alternatives to .NET?">David Heinemeir Hansson caught</a> Scoble <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/07/17.html#a10678" title="Microsoft needs to move faster, McManus says">lusting after Rails and
Django</a>. I&#8217;ve been interested in understanding whether Rails is
having the same impact on the .NET crowd as it is having on the Java
crowd. If you&#8217;re coming from a .NET background, weigh in on <a href="http://scoblecomments2.scripting.com/comments?u=1011&amp;p=10678&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fradio.weblogs.com%2F0001011%2F2005%2F07%2F17.html%23a10678">Scoble&#8217;s
comment thread</a>.</p>

<p>The .NET environment seems more locked down than Java&#8217;s, which makes it
harder for developers to wander outside of the vendor product line. Most
people coming from Java have good experience with some form of
Linux/Unix and associated tools so the LAMP/friends environment and
conventions feel a bit more natural. Perhaps <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2005/07/12.html#a1265" title="LAMP and WAMP">Udell&#8217;s advocacy</a>
of <a href="http://www.wampserver.com/en/index.php" title="Install PHP5 Apache MySQL on Windows : WAMP5">WAMP</a> can put a chink the armor? I wonder how hard it would be to
slap Ruby, Rails, and Ruby Gems or Django and Python into the WAMP
click-and-install packaging. This would probably go a long way in
getting people to take a look.</p>

<p>Anyway, this comes only a month or so after <a href="http://news.com.com/Microsoft+looks+to+extinguish+LAMP/2100-1012_3-5746549.html" title="Microsoft looks to extinguish LAMP">reports of a new Microsoft
strategy to &#8220;extinguish LAMP&#8221;</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Having products that are engineered to work together&#8211;something
  open-source competitors cannot do&#8211;will ultimately make Microsoft
  products easier to run and more cost-effective over time, said Paul
  Flessner, senior vice president of server applications.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There you have it folks - we&#8217;re incapable of building &#8220;products&#8221; that
work together. Being on Microsoft&#8217;s radar means that we&#8217;re going to have
to be even more diligent in refuting baseless claims about our tools and
processes. Luckily, they don&#8217;t seem to understand our core philosophy
and, like most, see our approaches as <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/blogs/node/572" title="How much scalability do we really need?">quick-and-dirty</a> rather
than simple and elegant. </p>

<p>I have a feeling this is going to heat up over the next few months.</p>

					<p>I just had a chance to finally listen to the <a href="http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail149.html" title="Gillmor Gang - June 18">latest Gillmor Gang</a>&#8230;</p>

<p><small>UPDATE: I goofed and ended up listening to the June 2004 episode. It&#8217;s still an excellent episode&#8211;and one I don&#8217;t remember hearing last year&#8211;but is not nearly as timely as I had thought.</small></p>

<p>&#8230; with Mitchell Kertzman, a venture capitalist
with <a href="http://www.humwin.com/">Hummer Winblad Venture Partners</a>.
He talks about an investment that&#8217;s in progress. I&#8217;m just going to dump out a whole segment 
from him because it&#8217;s great stuff:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We are actually in the process of making an investment in a company
  where open source is a key part of their plan in two ways.  The first
  is, that they are building on top of the so called &#8220;open source
  commodity stack&#8221; &#8212; that&#8217;s everything from x86 processors, to Linux
  OS, to the whole LAMP aggregation of core software stack.</p>
  
  <p>So I think one of the huge breakthroughs&#8211;I&#8217;ve been running software
  companies before I did this for 30 years&#8211;and in my experience in
  running software companies that deal in enterprise software you may
  have a product that you sell to an enterprise customer but you had to
  drag around this expensive platform with you.</p>
  
  <p>So if I want to sell my software to a customer, I might be selling
  them my software for a few hundred thousand dollars but in order to
  run it they might have to buy some expensive Sun servers and some
  Oracle databases and some application servers and the cost of that
  stack meant that you were pulling a boat anchor around with you.  The
  commodity stack, with its performance and quality these days, means
  that software companies don&#8217;t have to do that anymore. </p>
  
  <p>You don&#8217;t have to spend .5 million dollars of your first round of
  financing to buy the infrastructure you need to build and test your
  products. And it also means that you can sell your software to
  customers without the incremental costs.</p>
  
  <p>The company we&#8217;re looking at, and <em>all</em> companies we&#8217;re looking at
  now are taking advantage of the lower cost
  to market of the commodity stack.</p>
  
  <p>I think that&#8217;s a <em>huge</em> development in software..</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Money understands why <em>less code</em> is important, that&#8217;s a Good Thing,
even if you <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/entrepreneurs_angels_and_the_cost_of_launch.php">don&#8217;t think you need
it</a>.</p>

<p>Mitchell goes on to talk about why Java isn&#8217;t looking as attractive as it once
did when the hype machine was in full swing and the world was a
different place:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When I first started doing this, everyone was doing J2EE backends.
  &#8230;  We still have companies that are doing J2EE backends but the
  questions that are being asked lately are very interesting. When Java
  was first being developed, the portability of Java was a huge part of
  its attractiveness. The write-once, deploy-anywhere was extremely
  compelling. The interesting thing, if you stop and look now is that
  Linux essentially has made that, ummmm, almost moot. There are now
  really two environments: there is .NET and there is Linux. And so the
  portability of Java, since, according to Microsoft, it doesn&#8217;t have a
  place in the .NET environment, therefore if you&#8217;re non-Microsoft you
  really have one environment that you&#8217;re deploying to (if you look into
  the future). So it does raise the question of why you need to carry
  this JVM around with you if you don&#8217;t need portability.</p>
  
  <p>And then the other interesting question is that, Java was useful when,
  uhh, if you consider that multi-tier or distributed application
  architectures used to communicate essentially for years by
  communicating binary data. Today, applications are really
  communicating by passing text back and forth, you know, XML or HTML,
  and Java isn&#8217;t particularly good at text processing so there&#8217;s an
  interesting development in [looking] at the scripting languages&#8211;at the
  <q>P</q> part of LAMP - PHP, Python, Perl, which are <strong>very</strong> good at
  text handling. This company we&#8217;re investing in is taking advantage of
  that. </p>
  
  <p>So I think we&#8217;re in an interesting period of evaluation on Java.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ahh man, this whole damn episode is amazing. I&#8217;m not transcribing the
whole thing, just go <a href="http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail149.html" title="Gillmor Gang - June 18">listen to it</a>.</p>
